My PhD was an incredible journey. Thinking back to the beginning of everything, it was hard to figure at that time the impact that such experience would have had on me. Despite their beauty, I cannot say that the past four years were the easiest of my life. The difficulties (often self-created!) that I had to face during my PhD were balanced by the deep passion that was backing up my daily work. Yet, it is unquestionable that the positive outcome of this experience was made possible by the people around me, whose presence and constant support helped me more than what any of them can imagine.

I want to thank Nicola M., for his invaluable lessons and for always having faith in me (and in Koopmans!). When I was struggling, his unconditional trust allowed me to work serenely and without any pressure.

A big thanks to Nicola C., who was the best co-supervisor I could dream of. His meticulousness, passion for understanding and knowledge of the field were always an example to me, and would continuously raise the bar pushing me to learn more and more. I could always, any time, count on him. For anything.

Thanks also to Edward, especially for the high-level expertise in coding in Python that he brought in the team.
