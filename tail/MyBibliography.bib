	abstract = {Koopmans-compliant functionals provide an orbital-density-dependent framework for an accurate evaluation of spectral properties; they are obtained by imposing a generalized piecewise-linearity condition on the total energy of the system with respect to the occupation of any orbital. In crystalline materials, due to the orbital-density-dependent nature of the functionals, minimization of the total energy to a ground state provides a set of minimizing variational orbitals that are localized and thus break the periodicity of the underlying lattice. Despite this, we show that Bloch symmetry can be preserved and it is possible to describe the electronic states with a band-structure picture, thanks to the Wannier-like character of the variational orbitals. We also present a method to unfold and interpolate the electronic bands from supercell (Γ-point) calculations, which enables us to calculate full band structures with Koopmans-compliant functionals. The results obtained for a set of benchmark semiconductors and insulators show very good agreement with state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory and experiments, underscoring the reliability of these spectral functionals in predicting band structures.},

This problem arises, for example, when density functionals with explicit self-interaction correction are used for systems of electrons. There, unitary invariance cannot be used to reformulate the minimization of the energy with respect to each of the functions as an eigenvalue problem as can be done for the commonly used GGA-DFT and Hartree-Fock theory. By including optimization with respect to unitary transformations as an explicit step in the iterative minimization procedure, fast convergence can, nevertheless, be obtained. Furthermore, by working with two sets of orthonormal functions, the optimal functions and a set of eigenfunctions, the implementation of the extended functional form in existing software becomes easier. The additional computations arising from the lack of unitary invariance can largely be carried out in parallel.},

	abstract = {Most computational studies in chemistry and materials science are based on the use of density functional theory. Although the exact density functional is unknown, several density functional approximations (DFAs) offer a good balance of affordable computational cost and semi-quantitative accuracy for applications. The development of DFAs still continues on many fronts, and several new DFAs aiming for improved accuracy are published every year. However, the numerical stability of these DFAs is an often overlooked problem. In this work, we look at all 592 DFAs for three-dimensional systems available in Libxc 5.2.2 and examine the convergence of the density functional total energy based on tabulated atomic Hartree-Fock wave functions. We show that several recent DFAs, including the celebrated SCAN family of functionals, suffer from strong numerical instabilities that make the functionals unsuitable for high-precision studies. In fact, their convergence with respect to quadrature is impractically slow, requiring thousands of radial quadrature points to achieve reliable total energies. These results suggest that numerical stability should be a core consideration in the development of new density functionals.},

Here, we present a simple and inexpensive method that achieves this by means of nonempirical optimal tuning of the parameters of a screened range-separated hybrid functional. The tuning involves the enforcement of an ansatz that generalizes the ionization potential theorem to the removal of an electron from an occupied state described by a localized Wannier function in a modestly sized supercell calculation. The method is benchmarked against experiment for a set of systems ranging from narrow band-gap semiconductors to large band-gap insulators, spanning a range of fundamental band gaps from 0.2 to 14.2 electronvolts (eV), and is found to yield quantitative accuracy across the board, with a mean absolute error of ∼0.1 eV and a maximal error of ∼0.2 eV.},

	abstract = {Modeling polaron defects is an important aspect of computational materials science, but the description of unpaired spins in density functional theory (DFT) often suffers from delocalization error. To diagnose and correct the overdelocalization of spin defects, we report an implementation of density-corrected (DC-)DFT and its analytic energy gradient. In DC-DFT, an exchange-correlation functional is evaluated using a Hartree–Fock density, thus incorporating electron correlation while avoiding self-interaction error. Results for an electron polaron in models of titania and a hole polaron in Al-doped silica demonstrate that geometry optimization with semilocal functionals drives significant structural distortion, including the elongation of several bonds, such that subsequent single-point calculations with hybrid functionals fail to afford a localized defect even in cases where geometry optimization with the hybrid functional does localize the polaron. This has significant implications for traditional workflows in computational materials science, where semilocal functionals are often used for structure relaxation. DC-DFT calculations provide a mechanism to detect situations where delocalization error is likely to affect the results.},

For materials with light elements, the band gap renormalization is often larger than 0.3 eV, and up to 0.7 eV. This effect cannot be ignored if accurate band gaps are sought. For infrared-active materials, global agreement with available experimental data is obtained only when non-adiabatic effects are taken into account.

	abstract = {The widely used density functional theory (DFT) has a major drawback of underestimating the band gaps of materials. Wannier–Koopmans method (WKM) was recently developed for band gap calculations with accuracy on a par with more complicated methods. WKM has been tested for main group covalent semiconductors, alkali halides, 2D materials, and organic crystals. Here we apply the WKM to another interesting type of material system: the transition metal (TM) oxides. TM oxides can be classified as either with d0 or d10 closed shell occupancy or partially occupied open shell configuration, and the latter is known to be strongly correlated Mott insulators. We found that, while WKM provides adequate band gaps for the d0 and d10 TM oxides, it fails to provide correct band gaps for the group with partially occupied d states. This issue is also found in other mean-field approaches like the GW calculations. We believe that the problem comes from a strong interaction between the occupied and unoccupied d-state Wannier functions in a partially occupied d-state system. We also found that, for pseudopotential calculations including deep core levels, it is necessary to remove the electron densities of these deep core levels in the Hartree and exchange–correlation energy functional when calculating the WKM correction parameters for the d-state Wannier functions.},

Thanks to the development of methodology and softwares during the last 30 years, the capability of GW method and Bethe–Salpeter equation to deal with real systems is elevated substantially, while they also exhibit many advantages over other first-principles methods in band structures, ionization potentials, electron affinities, optical spectra, and so on.

	abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory has become state-of-the-art for describing photophysical and photochemical processes in extended materials due to its affordable cost. The inclusion of exact exchange was shown to be essential for the correct description of the long-range asymptotics of electronic interactions and thus a well-balanced description of valence, Rydberg and charge-transfer excitations. Several approaches for an efficient treatment of exact exchange have been established for the ground state, while implementations for excited-state properties are rare. Furthermore, the high computational costs required for excited-state properties in comparison to ground-state computations often hinder large-scale applications on periodic systems with hybrid functional accuracy. We therefore propose two approximate schemes for improving computational efficiency for the treatment of exact exchange. Within the auxiliary density matrix method (ADMM), exact exchange is estimated using a relatively small auxiliary basis and the introduced basis-set incompleteness error is compensated by an exchange density functional correction term. Benchmark results for a test set of 35 molecules demonstrate that the mean absolute error introduced by ADMM is smaller than 0.2 pm for excited-state bond lengths and in the range of 0.02 - 0.06 eV for vertical excitation, adiabatic excitation and fluorescence energies. Computational timings for a series of covalent-organic frameworks demonstrate that a speed-up of at least one order of magnitude can be achieved for ES geometry optimizations in comparison to conventional hybrid functionals. The second method is to use a semi-empirical tight binding approximation for both Coulomb and exchange contributions to the excited-state kernel. This simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximation (sTDA) achieves an accuracy comparable to approximated hybrid density functional theory when referring to highly accurate coupled-cluster reference data. We find that excited-state bond lengths deviate by 1.1 pm on average and mean absolute errors in vertical excitation, adiabatic excitation and fluorescence energies are in the range of 0.2 - 0.5 eV. In comparison to ADMM-approximated hybrid functional theory, sTDA accelerates the computation of broad-band excitation spectra by one order of magnitude, suggesting its potential use for large-scale screening purposes.},

In a recent work by the present authors, explicit expressions for bandgap prediction with all common types of exchange-correlation functionals have been derived without invoking the concept of exchange-correlation energy functional derivative discontinuity at all. We here analyze the two approaches and establish their connection and difference. The present analysis further leads to several important results: (1) The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in DFT has as much meaning in describing electron addition as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in describing electron removal. (2) Every term in the total energy functional contributes to the energy gap because of the discontinuity of the derivative of the density (or density matrix) with respect to the number of electrons, ((∂ρs(r′,r))/∂N)vs, at integers. (3) Consistent with the Perdew-Levy-Sham-Schlüter conclusion that the exact Kohn-Sham energy gap differs from the fundamental bandgap by a finite correction due to the functional derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy, we show that the exchange-correlation functional cannot be an explicit and differentiable functional of the electron density, either local or nonlocal. The last result is further strengthened when we consider Mott insulators. There, the exact exchange-correlation functional needs to have an explicitly discontinuous (nondifferentiable) dependence on the density or the density matrix. (4) We obtain exact conditions on the derivatives of total energy with respect to the spin-up and spin-down number of electrons.},

Motivated by recent progress in the N-representability problem of the one-body density matrix for pure states, we propose a method to quantify the static contribution to the electronic correlation. By studying several molecular systems we show that our proposal correlates well with our intuition of static and dynamic electron correlation. Our results bring out the paramount importance of the occupancy of the highest occupied natural spin–orbital in such quantification.},

Acta 37, 329 (1975)], in which the correlation energy density is expressed in terms of the electron density and a Laplacian of the second-order Hartree-Fock density matrix, is restated as a formula involving the density and local kinetic-energy density. On insertion of gradient expansions for the local kinetic-energy density, density-functional formulas for the correlation energy and correlation potential are then obtained. Through numerical calculations on a number of atoms, positive ions, and molecules, of both open- and closed-shell type, it is demonstrated that these formulas, like the original Colle-Salvetti formulas, give correlation energies within a few percent., This article appears in the following collection:},

The focus is comparison of computed and experimental heats of formation and isomerization energies. In addition, the effect of an empirical dispersion correction term has been evaluated and found to improve agreement with the experimental data. For the 622 compounds, the mean absolute errors (MAE) in the heats of formation are 3.1, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.4 kcal/mol for B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) with the dispersion correction. A diverse set of 34 isomerizations highlights specific issues of general interest, such as performance on differences in steric effects, conjugation, and bonding. The corresponding MAEs for the isomerizations are 2.7, 2.4, 2.2, and 1.9 kcal/mol. Improvement is obtained for isomerizations of amines and alcohols when both polarization and diffuse functions are used, but the overstabilization of linear alkanes compared to branched isomers can be relieved only with the dispersion correction. Besides the insights on DFT methods, the study also aimed to quantify the gains in accuracy that can be achieved by replacing energetics from NDO-based semiempirical methods with DFT results. Since the MAEs obtained with the PDDG/PM3 method for the 622 heats of formation and 34 isomerizations are 2.8 and 2.3 kcal/mol, negligible advantage in accuracy for the B3LYP-based methods emerged in the absence of the dispersion corrections.},

Such fractional-spin states are shown to be ensembles of degenerate ground states with normal spins. It is proven here that the energy of the exact functional for fractional-spin states is a constant, equal to the energy of the comprising degenerate pure-spin states. Dramatic deviations from this exact constancy condition exist with all approximate functionals, leading to large static correlation errors for strongly correlated systems, such as chemical bond dissociation and band structure of Mott insulators. This is demonstrated with numerical calculations for several molecular systems. Approximating the constancy behavior for fractional spins should be a major aim in functional constructions and should open the frontier for density functional theory to describe strongly correlated systems. The key results are also shown to apply in reduced density-matrix functional theory.},

For the core electrons, the details of the interaction of the electrons in a single nk group are neglected, but an approximate correction is made for the fact that the distributed charge of an electron does not contribute to the field acting on itself (§2).For a given atom the object of the work is to find a field such that the solutions of the wave equation for the core electrons in this field (corrected as just mentioned for each core electron) give a distribution of charge which reproduces the field. This is called the self-consistent field, and the process of finding it is one of successive approximation (§ 3).Approximations to the self-consistent field have been found for He (§ 4), Rb+ (§ 5), Na+, Cl− (§ 9). For He the energy parameter for the solution of the wave equation for one electron in the self-consistent field of the nucleus and the other corresponds to an ionisation potential of 24·85 volts (observed 24·6 volts); this agreement suggests that for other atoms the values of the energy parameter in the self-consistent field (corrected for each core electron) will probably give good approximations to the X-ray terms (§4).The most extensive work has been carried out for Rb+. The distribution of charge given by the wave functions in the self-consistent field is compared with the distribution calculated by other methods (§ 6). The values of X-ray and optical terms calculated from the self-consistent field show satisfactory agreement with those observed (§ 7).The wave mechanical analogue of the case in which on the orbital model an internal and an external orbit of the same energy are possible is discussed (§ 8).},

For example, NaCl can dissociate to Na+0.4⋯Cl−0.4. Generally, q is positive when the lowest-unoccupied orbital energy of atom Y0 lies below the highest-occupied orbital energy of atom X0. The first 24 open sp-shell atoms of the Periodic Table can form 276 distinct unlike pairs XY, and in the local spin density approximation 174 of these display fractional-charge dissociation. Finding these lowest-energy solutions with standard quantum chemistry codes, however, requires special care. Self-interaction-corrected (SIC) semilocal approximations are exact for one-electron systems and also reduce the spurious fractional charge q. The original SIC of Perdew and Zunger typically reduces q to 0. A scaled-down SIC with better equilibrium properties sometimes fails to reduce q all the way to 0. The desideratum of “many-electron self-interaction freedom” is introduced as a generalization of the one-electron concept.},

	abstract = {Three size-consistency principles of electronic structure theory are set forth. “Separability” and “extensivity” are respected even by local or semilocal density functional approximations, which succeed for that and other reasons. The strong tendency of a separated subsystem to reject fractional electron number is a consequence of the derivative discontinuity of the energy; this “integer preference” is probably not respected by any practical density functional approximation. However, all three size-consistency principles are obeyed by theories which construct the energy from localized orbitals. The self-interaction correction (SIC) to the local spin density approximation favors localized orbitals for most systems. If this fails for metals, then SIC gives rise to a “false surface energy”. The self-interaction correction is reviewed, along with its exact-theory “doppelganger”, the derivative discontinuity. The latter reveals the physical content of the exact Kohn-Sham orbital energies and resolves the “band-gap problem”.},

A tight rigorous bound connects a density to its interacting ground-state energy via the one-body potential of the interacting system and the Kohn-Sham effective one-body potential of the auxiliary noninteracting system. A modified Kohn-Sham effective potential is defined such that its sum of lowest orbital energies equals the true interacting ground-state energy. Moreover, of all those effective potentials which differ by additive constants and which yield the true interacting ground-state density, this modified effective potential is the most invariant with respect to changes in the one-body potential of the true Hamiltonian. With the exception of the occurrence of certain linear dependencies, a density will not generally be associated with any ground-state wave function (is not wave function v representable) if that density can be generated by a special linear combination of three or more densities that arise from a common set of degenerate ground-state wave functions. Applicability of the "constrained search" approach to density-functional theory is emphasized for non-v-representable as well as for v-representable densities. In fact, a particular constrained ensemble search is revealed which provides a general sufficient condition for non-v representability by a wave function. The possible appearance of noninteger occupation numbers is discussed in connection with the existence of non-v representability for some Kohn-Sham noninteracting systems.},

	abstract = {The band lineup, or alignment, of semiconductors is investigated via first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). Twenty-one semiconductors including C, Si, and Ge in the diamond structure, BN, AlP, AlAs, AlSb, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs, InSb, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, CdSe, and CdTe in the zinc-blende structure, and GaN and ZnO in the wurtzite structure are considered in view of their fundamental and technological importance. Band alignments are determined using the valence and conduction band offsets from heterointerface calculations, the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) from surface calculations, and the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum relative to the branch point energy, or charge neutrality level, from bulk calculations. The performance of various approximations to DFT and MBPT, namely the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) semilocal functional, the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional, and the GW approximation with and without vertex corrections in the screened Coulomb interaction, is assessed using the GWΓ1 approximation as a reference, where first-order vertex corrections are included in the self-energy. The experimental IPs, EAs, and band offsets are well reproduced by GWΓ1 for most of the semiconductor surfaces and heterointerfaces considered in this study. The PBE and HSE functionals show sizable errors in the IPs and EAs, in particular for group II-VI semiconductors with wide band gaps, but are much better in the prediction of relative band positions or band offsets due to error cancellation. The performance of the GW approximation is almost on par with GWΓ1 as far as relative band positions are concerned. The band alignments based on average interfacial band offsets for all pairs of 17 semiconductors and branch point energies agree with explicitly calculated interfacial band offsets with small mean absolute errors of both ∼0.1eV, indicating a good overall transitivity of the band offsets. The alignment based on IPs from selected nonpolar surfaces performs comparably well in the prediction of band offsets at most of the considered interfaces. The maximum errors are, however, as large as 0.3, 0.4, and 0.7 eV for the alignments based on the average band offsets, branch point energies, and IPs, respectively. This margin of error should be taken into account when performing materials screening using these alignments.},

First-principles calculations have emerged as a powerful approach that complements experiments and can serve as a predictive tool in the identification and characterization of defects. The theoretical modeling of point defects in crystalline materials by means of electronic-structure calculations, with an emphasis on approaches based on density functional theory (DFT), is reviewed. A general thermodynamic formalism is laid down to investigate the physical properties of point defects independent of the materials class (semiconductors, insulators, and metals), indicating how the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as formation energy, entropy, and excess volume, can be obtained from electronic structure calculations. Practical aspects such as the supercell approach and efficient strategies to extrapolate to the isolated-defect or dilute limit are discussed. Recent advances in tractable approximations to the exchange-correlation functional (DFT+U, hybrid functionals) and approaches beyond DFT are highlighted. These advances have largely removed the long-standing uncertainty of defect formation energies in semiconductors and insulators due to the failure of standard DFT to reproduce band gaps. Two case studies illustrate how such calculations provide new insight into the physics and role of point defects in real materials.},

However, the application of LOSC to DFAs was mainly through a post self-consistent field (SCF) manner, and few results from applying LOSC to DFAs in an SCF manner have been reported. The reason is that the originally proposed SCF approach to SCF–LOSC calculation uses an approximate Hamiltonian and encounters convergence problems easily in practice. In this work, we develop a new SCF approach with a correct Hamiltonian and achieve reliable SCF–LOSC calculations. We demonstrate the capability of the new SCF approach for SCF–LOSC to correctly describe the electron densities, total energies, and energy-level alignment for the molecular dissociation process, while conventional DFAs or LOSC–DFAs with post-SCF calculations show large errors. This work demonstrates that the new SCF approach for SCF–LOSC would be a promising method for studying problems for correct electron densities and energy-level alignments in large systems.},

	abstract = {We present an efficient procedure for constructing nonempirical hybrid functionals to accurately predict band gaps of extended systems. We determine mixing parameters by enforcing the generalized Koopmans’ condition on localized electron states, which are achieved by inserting an optimized potential probe. Application of this scheme to a large set of materials yields band gaps with a mean error of 0.30 eV with respect to experiment. Next, we consider a perturbative one-shot approach in which the single-particle eigenvalues are calculated with the wave functions obtained at the semilocal level. In this way, the computational cost is reduced by ∼85\% without loss of accuracy. The scheme is found to be robust upon consideration of different defect species and functional forms.},

Three conditions that must be obeyed by the exact energy functional, but may or may not be obeyed by approximate ones, are often pointed out as important in general and for accurate computation of spectroscopic observables in particular. These are: (1) piecewise linearity as a function of the fractional particle number, (2) freedom from one-electron self-interaction, and (3) for a finite system, the functional derivative with respect to the density results in an asymptotic −1/r potential (in Hartree atomic units), where r is the distance from the system center. In this overview, we explain what these conditions are, what they address, and why each one is of importance for spectroscopy. We then show, using specific examples from the literature, that these three properties are related, but are not equivalent and need to be assessed individually.},

This approach allows for an exact solution of Dyson-like equations at all frequencies via a mapping to a matrix diagonalization, and provides simultaneously frequency-dependent (spectral) and frequency-integrated (thermodynamic) properties of the Dyson-inverted propagators. The transformation to a sum over poles is performed introducing nth order generalized Lorentzians as an improved basis set to represent the spectral function of a propagator.

(ii) Across an integer number of electrons, the exchange-correlation potential “jumps” by a constant, known as the derivative discontinuity (DD). Here we show analytically that in both the original and the generalized Kohn–Sham formulation of DFT the two properties are two sides of the same coin. The absence of a DD dictates deviation from piecewise linearity, but the latter, appearing as curvature, can be used to correct for the former, thereby restoring the physical meaning of orbital energies. A simple correction scheme for any semilocal and hybrid functional, even Hartree–Fock theory, is shown to be effective on a set of small molecules, suggesting a practical correction for the infamous DFT gap problem. We show that optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functionals can inherently minimize both DD and curvature, thus requiring no correction, and that this can be used as a sound theoretical basis for novel tuning strategies.},

Here, we show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, most of the required piecewise linearity of an arbitrary approximate density functional can be restored by careful consideration of the ensemble generalization of density-functional theory. Furthermore, the resulting formulation introduces the desired derivative discontinuity to any approximate exchange-correlation functional, even one that is explicitly density dependent. This opens the door to calculations of the ionization potential and electron affinity, even without explicit electron removal or addition. All these advances are achieved while neither introducing empiricism nor changing the underlying functional form.

	abstract = {Contemporary theories of defects and impurities in semiconductors rely to a large extent on supercell calculations within density-functional theory using the approximate local-density approximation (LDA) or generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals. Such calculations are, however, affected by considerable uncertainties associated with: (i) the “band-gap problem,” which occurs not only in the Kohn-Sham single-particle energies but also in the quasiparticle gap (LDA or GGA) calculated from total-energy differences, and (ii) supercell finite-size effects. In the case of the oxygen vacancy in ZnO, uncertainties (i) and (ii) have led to a large spread in the theoretical predictions, with some calculations suggesting negligible vacancy concentrations, even under Zn-rich conditions, and others predicting high concentrations. Here, we critically assess (i) the different methodologies to correct the band-gap problem. We discuss approaches based on the extrapolation of perturbations which open the band gap, and the self-consistent band-gap correction employing the LDA+U method for d and s states simultaneously. From the comparison of the results of different gap-correction, including also recent results from other literature, we conclude that to date there is no universal scheme for band gap correction in general defect systems. Therefore, we turn instead to classification of different types of defect behavior to provide guidelines on how the physically correct situation in an LDA defect calculation can be recovered. (ii) Supercell finite-size effects: We performed test calculations in large supercells of up to 1728 atoms, resolving a long-standing debate pertaining to image charge corrections for charged defects. We show that once finite-size effects not related to electrostatic interactions are eliminated, the analytic form of the image charge correction as proposed by Makov and Payne leads to size-independent defect formation energies, thus allowing the calculation of well-converged energies in fairly small supercells. We find that the delocalized contribution to the defect charge (i.e., the defect-induced change of the charge distribution) is dominated by the dielectric screening response of the host, which leads to an unexpected effective 1/L scaling of the image charge energy, despite the nominal 1/L3 scaling of the third-order term. Based on this analysis, we suggest that a simple scaling of the first order term by a constant factor (approximately 2/3) yields a simple but accurate image-charge correction for common supercell geometries. Finally, we discuss the theoretical controversy pertaining to the formation energy of the O vacancy in ZnO in light of the assessment of different methodologies in the present work, and we review the present experimental situation on the topic.},

This is achieved by augmenting standard density functionals with simple but physically motivated orbital-density-dependent corrections. These corrections act on a set of localized orbitals that, in periodic systems, resemble maximally localized Wannier functions. At variance with the original, direct supercell implementation [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021051 (2018)], we discuss here i) the complex but efficient formalism required for a periodic-boundary code using explicit Brillouin zone sampling, and ii) the calculation of the screened Koopmans corrections with density-functional perturbation theory. The implementation in the QUANTUM ESPRESSO distribution and the application to prototypical insulating and semiconducting systems are presented and discussed.},

Both Gross–Oliveira–Kohn (GOK) and N-centered ensemble formalisms, which are mathematically very similar and allow for an in-principle-exact description of neutral and charged electronic excitations, respectively, are discussed. Key exact results, for example, the equivalence between the infamous derivative discontinuity problem and the description of weight dependencies in the ensemble exchange-correlation density functional, are highlighted. The variational evaluation of orbital-dependent ensemble Hartree-exchange (Hx) energies is discussed in detail. We show in passing that state-averaging individual exact Hx energies can lead to severe (although solvable) v-representability issues. Finally, we explore the possibility of using the concept of density-driven correlation, which has been introduced recently and does not exist in regular ground-state DFT, for improving state-of-the-art correlation density-functional approximations for ensembles. The present review reflects the efforts of a growing community to turn ensemble DFT into a rigorous and reliable low-cost computational method for excited states. We hope that, in the near future, this contribution will stimulate new formal and practical developments in the field.},

For these devices, in which the carriers probe nanometre-scale local disorder, the commonly employed virtual crystal approximation (VCA) is inadequate. Although the VCA produces small-cell E(k) relations it fails to include local disorder. In contrast, random-alloy supercell calculations do include local disorder but only deliver band extrema and supercell (not small cell) E(k) relations. Small-cell E(k) relations are, however, needed to interpret transport parameters such as effective masses. This work presents a method to extract the necessary approximate small-cell E(k) relations from the disordered supercell states. The method is applied to AlGaAs and gives significantly improved energy gaps versus the VCA, as well as approximate effective masses. The results illuminate the bowing of the Γ-valley gap and the good agreement with bulk experimental data shows that this method is well suited for nanodevices.},

This paper provides an exact method for perfect supercells to unfold the zone folded E(k) diagrams into a meaningful bulk dispersion relation. In addition, a modification to the algorithm for use with imperfect supercells is presented.

	abstract = {Wannier functions are real-space representations of Bloch orbitals that provide a useful picture for chemical bonding and offer a localized description of single-particle wave functions. There is a unitary freedom in the construction of Wannier functions from Bloch orbitals, which can be chosen to produce Wannier functions that have advantageous properties. A popular choice for this freedom is the minimization of spatial variance, which leads to maximally localized Wannier functions. We minimize a weighted sum of the spatial and energy variances, yielding what we call dually localized Wannier functions. Localization in energy results in Wannier functions that are associated with a particular energy and allows for dually localized Wannier functions to be comprised of occupied and unoccupied spaces simulatneously. This can lead to Wannier functions that are fractionally occupied, which is a key feature that is used in correcting the delocalization error in density functional approximations. We show how this type of localization results in bonding (antibonding) functions for the occupied (unoccupied) spaces around the frontier energy of silicon in the diamond lattice and of molecular ethylene. Dually localized Wannier functions therefore offer a relevant description for chemical bonding and are well suited to orbital-dependent methods that associate Wannier functions with specific energy ranges without the need to consider the occupied and unoccupied spaces separately.},

Then, for all of these 100 molecules, we calculate the HOMO energy within second and third-order perturbation theory (PT2 and PT3), and, GW as post-Hartree-Fock methods. We found GW to be the most accurate of these three approximations for the ionization potential, by far. Going beyond GW by adding more diagrams is a tedious and dangerous activity: We tried to complement GW with second-order exchange (SOX), with second-order screened exchange (SOSEX), with interacting electron-hole pairs (WTDHF), and with a GW density-matrix (γGW). Only the γGW result has a positive impact. Finally using an improved hybrid functional for the non-interacting Green’s function, considering it as a cheap way to approximate self-consistency, the accuracy of the simplest GW approximation improves even more. We conclude that GW is a miracle: Its subtle balance makes GW both accurate and fast.},

Structure associated directly with the band gap is not manifest, so the Γ15−Γ1 energy is determined indirectly to be 14.2 ± 0.2 eV. The n=1 exciton state generates the first strong structure in Δ˜ε and we suggest that the exciton-phonon interaction, along with a central-cell correction, can give a significant contribution to its binding energy. Structures at higher energy have been associated with the interband transitions L′3→L1 and L′2→L1 between the crystal-field-split valence band at L and the lower conduction band. The strong electron-hole interaction modifies the expected line shape and a hyperbolic exciton, associated with the transitions at L, may exist as an antiresonance in the continuum. A strong feature at 22.2 eV in Δ˜ε is associated with excitonic transitions at X involving the second d-like conduction band. The corresponding peak at 26.4 eV in Δ[Im(−1˜ε)] overlaps the "valence-band" plasmon at 24.6 eV. No evidence for double excitations is found around 25 eV in either Δ˜ε or Δ[Im(−1˜ε)].

Based on extensive numerical results, the SC methods have been demonstrated to be capable of reducing the delocalization error effectively and producing accurate descriptions for many critical and challenging problems, including the fundamental gap, photoemission spectroscopy, charge transfer excitations and polarizability. In the development of SC methods, the SC methods were mainly implemented in the QM4D package that was developed in the Yang laboratory for research development. The heavy dependency on the QM4D package hinders the SC methods from access by researchers for broad applications. In this work, we developed a reliable and efficient implementation , LibSC for the global scaling correction (GSC) method and the localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) method. LibSC will serve as a light-weight and open-source library that can be easily accessed by the quantum chemistry community. The implementation of LibSC is carefully modularized to provide the essential functionalities for conducting calculations of the SC methods. In addition, LibSC provides simple and consistent interfaces to support multiple popular programing languages, including C, C++ and Python. In addition to the development of the library, we also integrated LibSC with two popular and open-source quantum chemistry packages, the Psi4 package and the PySCF package, which provides immediate access for general users to perform calculations with SC methods.},

	abstract = {Excitation gaps are of considerable significance in electronic structure theory. Two different gaps are of particular interest. The fundamental gap is defined by charged excitations, as the difference between the first ionization potential and the first electron affinity. The optical gap is defined by a neutral excitation, as the difference between the energies of the lowest dipole-allowed excited state and the ground state. Within many-body perturbation theory, the fundamental gap is the difference between the corresponding lowest quasi-hole and quasi-electron excitation energies, and the optical gap is addressed by including the interaction between a quasi-electron and a quasi-hole. A long-standing challenge has been the attainment of a similar description within density functional theory (DFT), with much debate on whether this is an achievable goal even in principle. Recently, we have constructed and applied a new approach to this problem. Anchored in the rigorous theoretical framework of the generalized Kohn–Sham equation, our method is based on a range-split hybrid functional that uses exact long-range exchange. Its main novel feature is that the range-splitting parameter is not a universal constant but rather is determined from first principles, per system, based on satisfaction of the ionization potential theorem. For finite-sized objects, this DFT approach mimics successfully, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the quasi-particle picture of many-body theory. Specifically, it allows for the extraction of both the fundamental and the optical gap from one underlying functional, based on the HOMO–LUMO gap of a ground-state DFT calculation and the lowest excitation energy of a linear-response time-dependent DFT calculation, respectively. In particular, it produces the correct optical gap for the difficult case of charge-transfer and charge-transfer-like scenarios, where conventional functionals are known to fail. In this perspective, we overview the formal and practical challenges associated with gap calculations, explain our new approach and how it overcomes previous difficulties, and survey its application to a variety of systems.},

In its original formulation, the polaron problem considers a single charge carrier in a polar crystal interacting with its surrounding lattice. Depending on the spatial extension of the polaron quasiparticle, originating from the coupling between the excess charge and the phonon field, one speaks of small or large polarons. This chapter discusses the modeling of small polarons in real materials, with a particular focus on the archetypal polaron material TiO2. After an introductory part, surveying the fundamental theoretical and experimental aspects of the physics of polarons, the chapter examines how to model small polarons using first-principles schemes in order to predict, understand, and interpret a variety of polaron properties in bulk phases and surfaces. Following the spirit of this handbook, different types of computational procedures and prescriptions are presented with specific instructions on the setup required to model polaron effects.},

Solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) for electron–hole pairs usually yields accurate predictions of absorption spectra, but it is computationally expensive, especially if thermal averages of spectra computed for multiple configurations are required. We present a method based on machine learning to evaluate a key quantity entering the definition of absorption spectra: the dielectric screening. We show that our approach yields a model for the screening that is transferable between multiple configurations sampled during first principles molecular dynamics simulations; hence it leads to a substantial improvement in the efficiency of calculations of finite temperature spectra. We obtained computational gains of one to two orders of magnitude for systems with 50 to 500 atoms, including liquids, solids, nanostructures, and solid/liquid interfaces. Importantly, the models of dielectric screening derived here may be used not only in the solution of the BSE but also in developing functionals for time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Overall, our work provides a strategy to combine machine learning with electronic structure calculations to accelerate first principles simulations of excited-state properties.},

However, the calculated binding energies are smaller than experimental values. This discrepancy would be due to the self-interaction error within the approximated exchange-correlation density functional used in this calculation. Therefore, we also show perturbative calculations based on an impurity potential without the self-interaction error to estimate the binding energies of the 1s(A1) donor state. The estimated binding energy in the largest supercell agrees well with the experimental value.},

A method based on a direct optimization approach as well as the maximum overlap method is presented, and the performance is compared with previously proposed SCF strategies. Excited-state solutions correspond to saddle points of the energy as a function of the electronic degrees of freedom. The approach presented here makes use of a preconditioner determined with the help of the maximum overlap method to guide the convergence on a target nth-order saddle point. This method is found to be more robust and converge faster than previously proposed SCF approaches for a set of 89 excited states of molecules. A limited-memory formulation of the symmetric rank-one method for updating the inverse Hessian is found to give the best performance. A conical intersection for the carbon monoxide molecule is calculated without resorting to fractional occupation numbers. Calculations on the excited states of the hydrogen atom and a doubly excited state of the dihydrogen molecule using a self-interaction corrected functional are presented.

	abstract = {A direct orbital optimization method is presented for density functional calculations of excited electronic states using either a real space grid or a plane wave basis set. The method is variational, provides atomic forces in the excited states, and can be applied to Kohn-Sham (KS) functionals as well as orbital-density dependent functionals (ODD) including explicit self-interaction correction. The implementation for KS functionals involves two nested loops: (1) An inner loop for finding a stationary point in a subspace spanned by the occupied and a few virtual orbitals corresponding to the excited state; (2) an outer loop for minimizing the energy in a tangential direction in the space of the orbitals. For ODD functionals, a third loop is used to find the unitary transformation that minimizes the energy functional among occupied orbitals only. Combined with the maximum overlap method, the algorithm converges in challenging cases where conventional self-consistent field algorithms tend to fail. The benchmark tests presented include two charge-transfer excitations in nitrobenzene and an excitation of CO to degenerate \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast\$ orbitals where the importance of complex orbitals is illustrated. An application of the method to several metal-to-ligand charge-transfer and metal-centred excited states of an Fe\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm II\}\$ photosensitizer complex is described and the results compared to reported experimental estimates. The method is also used to study the effect of Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction on valence and Rydberg excited states of several molecules, both singlet and triplet states, and the performance compared to semilocal and hybrid functionals.},

	abstract = {Self-consistent calculations using the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction (PZ-SIC) to local density and gradient dependent energy functionals are presented for the binding energy and equilibrium geometry of small molecules as well as energy barriers of reactions. The effect of the correction is to reduce binding energy and bond lengths and increase activation energy barriers when bond breaking is involved. The accuracy of the corrected functionals varies strongly, the correction to the binding energy being too weak for the local density approximation but too strong for the gradient dependent functionals considered. For the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, a scaling of the PZ-SIC by one half gives improved results on average for both binding energy and bond lengths. The PZ-SIC does not necessarily give more accurate total energy, but it can result in a better cancellation of errors. An essential aspect of these calculations is the use of complex orbitals. A restriction to real orbitals leads to less accurate results as was recently shown for atoms [S. Klüpfel, P. Klüpfel, and H. Jónsson, Phys. Rev. A 84, 050501 (2011) https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.84.050501.]. The molecular geometry of radicals can be strongly affected by PZ-SIC. An incorrect, non-linear structure of the C2H radical predicted by PBE is corrected by PZ-SIC. The CH3 radical is correctly predicted to be planar when complex orbitals are used, while it is non-planar when the PZ-SIC calculation is restricted to real orbitals.},

	abstract = {Obtaining a precise theoretical description of the spectral properties of liquid water poses challenges for both molecular dynamics (MD) and electronic structure methods. The lower computational cost of the Koopmans-compliant functionals with respect to Green’s function methods allows the simulations of many MD trajectories, with a description close to the state-of-art quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections method (QSGW + fxc). Thus, we explore water spectral properties when different MD approaches are used, ranging from classical MD to first-principles MD, and including nuclear quantum effects. We have observed that different MD approaches lead to up to 1 eV change in the average band gap; thus, we focused on the band gap dependence with the geometrical properties of a system to explain such spread. We have evaluated the changes in the band gap due to variations in the intramolecular O–H bond distance and HOH angle, as well as the intermolecular hydrogen bond O···O distance and the OHO angles. We have observed that the dominant contribution comes from the O–H bond length; the O···O distance plays a secondary role, and the other geometrical properties do not significantly influence the gap. Furthermore, we analyze the electronic density of states (DOS), where the KIPZ functional shows good agreement with the DOS obtained with state-of-art approaches employing quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections. The O–H bond length also significantly influences the DOS. When nuclear quantum effects are considered, broadening of the peaks driven by the broader distribution of the O–H bond lengths is observed, leading to a closer agreement with the experimental photoemission spectra.},

	abstract = {We introduce a spectral density-functional theory which can be used to compute energetics and spectra of real strongly correlated materials using methods, algorithms, and computer programs of the electronic structure theory of solids. The approach considers the total free energy of a system as a functional of a local electronic Green function which is probed in the region of interest. Since we have a variety of notions of locality in our formulation, our method is manifestly basis-set dependent. However, it produces the exact total energy and local excitational spectrum provided that the exact functional is extremized. The self-energy of the theory appears as an auxiliary mass operator similar to the introduction of the ground-state Kohn-Sham potential in density-functional theory. It is automatically short ranged in the same region of Hilbert space which defines the local Green function. We exploit this property to find good approximations to the functional. For example, if electronic self-energy is known to be local in some portion of Hilbert space, a good approximation to the functional is provided by the corresponding local dynamical mean-field theory. A simplified implementation of the theory is described based on the linear muffin-tin orbital method widely used in electronic structure calculations. We demonstrate the power of the approach on the long standing problem of the anomalous volume expansion of metallic plutonium.},

	abstract = {Piecewise linearity of the energy with respect to fractional electron removal or addition is a requirement of an electronic structure method that necessitates the presence of a derivative discontinuity at integer electron occupation. Semi-local exchange-correlation (xc) approximations within density functional theory (DFT) fail to reproduce this behavior, giving rise to deviations from linearity with a convex global curvature that is evidence of many-electron, self-interaction error and electron delocalization. Popular functional tuning strategies focus on reproducing piecewise linearity, especially to improve predictions of optical properties. In a divergent approach, Hubbard U-augmented DFT (i.e., DFT+U) treats self-interaction errors by reducing the local curvature of the energy with respect to electron removal or addition from one localized subshell to the surrounding system. Although it has been suggested that DFT+U should simultaneously alleviate global and local curvature in the atomic limit, no detailed study on real systems has been carried out to probe the validity of this statement. In this work, we show when DFT+U should minimize deviations from linearity and demonstrate that a “+U” correction will never worsen the deviation from linearity of the underlying xc approximation. However, we explain varying degrees of efficiency of the approach over 27 octahedral transition metal complexes with respect to transition metal (Sc–Cu) and ligand strength (CO, NH3, and H2O) and investigate select pathological cases where the delocalization error is invisible to DFT+U within an atomic projection framework. Finally, we demonstrate that the global and local curvatures represent different quantities that show opposing behavior with increasing ligand field strength, and we identify where these two may still coincide.},

	abstract = {The conventional analysis of Perdew and Levy, and Sham and Schlüter shows that the functional derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation density functional plays a critical role in the correct prediction of bandgaps, or the chemical hardness. In a recent work by the present authors, explicit expressions for bandgap prediction with all common types of exchange-correlation functionals have been derived without invoking the concept of exchange-correlation energy functional derivative discontinuity at all. We here analyze the two approaches and establish their connection and difference. The present analysis further leads to several important results: (1) The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in DFT has as much meaning in describing electron addition as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in describing electron removal. (2) Every term in the total energy functional contributes to the energy gap because of the discontinuity of the derivative of the density (or density matrix) with respect to the number of electrons, ((∂ρs(r′,r))/∂N)vs((∂ρs(r′,r))/∂N)vs{\textless}math overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}({\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}({\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}∂{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}ρ{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}s{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}({\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="bold"{\textgreater}r{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}′{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater},{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="bold"{\textgreater}r{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}){\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}){\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}/{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}∂{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}N{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}){\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}v{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}s{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}, at integers. (3) Consistent with the Perdew-Levy-Sham-Schlüter conclusion that the exact Kohn-Sham energy gap differs from the fundamental bandgap by a finite correction due to the functional derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy, we show that the exchange-correlation functional cannot be an explicit and differentiable functional of the electron density, either local or nonlocal. The last result is further strengthened when we consider Mott insulators. There, the exact exchange-correlation functional needs to have an explicitly discontinuous (nondifferentiable) dependence on the density or the density matrix. (4) We obtain exact conditions on the derivatives of total energy with respect to the spin-up and spin-down number of electrons.},

Being an exact theory on one hand and computationally efficient on the other hand, DFT allows to address large and complex many-electron systems and accurately predict their properties. The predictive power of DFT critically depends though on an accurate approximation to the generally unknown exchange-correlation (xc) energy functional. Approximations can be constructed from first principles by satisfying known properties of the exact functional. In this work I review two such exact properties: the asymptotic behavior of the xc energy density per particle and the asymptotic behavior of the Kohn-Sham potential, in finite many-electron systems. The derivation of the asymptotic forms for both quantities is reviewed, employing the concepts of the adiabatic connection and of the xc hole with relation to the first quantity and the exact electron factorization approach for the second one. Furthermore, it is shown that the correct asymptotic behavior of one of the aforementioned quantities does not guarantee a correct behavior of the other. These quantities are related via the xc hole response function, which is defined, examined and its exact exchange part is analytically derived. The extent to which existing xc approximations satisfy the named exact properties is reviewed and the relationship between correct asymptotics and freedom from one-electron self-interaction in DFT is discussed. Finally, a strategy for development of advanced approximations for exchange and correlation with a correct asymptotic behavior is suggested.},

	abstract = {Wannier90 is an open-source computer program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch states. It is interfaced to many widely used electronic-structure codes thanks to its independence from the basis sets representing these Bloch states. In the past few years the development of Wannier90 has transitioned to a community-driven model; this has resulted in a number of new developments that have been recently released in Wannier90 v3.0. In this article we describe these new functionalities, that include the implementation of new features for wannierisation and disentanglement (symmetry-adapted Wannier functions, selectively-localised Wannier functions, selected columns of the density matrix) and the ability to calculate new properties (shift currents and Berry-curvature dipole, and a new interface to many-body perturbation theory); performance improvements, including parallelisation of the core code; enhancements in functionality (support for spinor-valued Wannier functions, more accurate methods to interpolate quantities in the Brillouin zone); improved usability (improved plotting routines, integration with high-throughput automation frameworks), as well as the implementation of modern software engineering practices (unit testing, continuous integration, and automatic source-code documentation). These new features, capabilities, and code development model aim to further sustain and expand the community uptake and range of applicability, that nowadays spans complex and accurate dielectric, electronic, magnetic, optical, topological and transport properties of materials.},

Here, we study the non-Koopmans behavior of local and semilocal density-functional theory (DFT) total energy methods as a means to quantify and to correct self-interaction errors. We introduce a non-Koopmans self-interaction correction that generalizes the Perdew-Zunger scheme, and demonstrate its considerably improved performance in correcting the deficiencies of DFT approximations for self-interaction problems of fundamental and practical relevance.},

	abstract = {Density-functional theory is an extremely powerful and widely used tool for quantum simulations. It reformulates the electronic-structure problem into a functional minimization with respect to the charge density of the energy of interacting electrons in an external potential. While exact in principle, it is approximate in practice, and even in its exact form it is meant to reproduce correctly only the total energy and its derivatives, such as forces, phonons, or dielectric properties. Quasiparticle levels are outside the scope of the theory, with the exception of the highest occupied state, since this is given by the derivative of the energy with respect to the number of electrons. A fundamental property of the exact energy functional is that of piecewise linearity at fractional occupations in between integer ﬁllings, but common approximations do not follow such piecewise behavior, leading to a discrepancy between total and partial electron removal energies. Since the former are typically well described, and the latter provide, via Janak’s theorem, orbital energies, this discrepancy leads to a poor comparison between predicted and measured spectroscopic properties. We illustrate here the powerful consequences that arise from imposing the constraint of piecewise linearity to the total energy functional, leading to the emergence of orbital-density-dependent functionals that (i) closely satisfy a generalized Koopmans condition, and (ii) are able to describe with great accuracy spectroscopic properties.},

In this electronic health record network cohort study using data from 69 million individuals, 62 354 of whom had a diagnosis of COVID-19, we assessed whether a diagnosis of COVID-19 (compared with other health events) was associated with increased rates of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, and whether patients with a history of psychiatric illness are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We used the TriNetX Analytics Network, a global federated network that captures anonymised data from electronic health records in 54 health-care organisations in the USA, totalling 69·8 million patients.

When the GGA HOMO—LUMO differences are explicitly corrected—such that they equal those calculated from electron densities—significant improvements in NMR shielding constants are obtained. The eigenvalues calculated from electron densities are also used to approximate the magnitude of the integer discontinuity in the exact exchange-correlation potential. The value of the Kohn—Sham HOMO eigenvalue is then considered. Although HOMO eigenvalues from high quality, asymptotically vanishing, exchange-correlation potentials are close to the negative of the ionization potential, HOMO eigenvalues from the GGA functionals are shifted upwards by approximately 50\% of the calculated integer discontinuity.

The expansion, which is taken up to sixth order in the density gradient, also includes the Laplacian of the density. In the case of a statically screened Coulomb interaction, we have calculated the coefficients of second- and fourth-order gradient terms both analytically and numerically. In analogy with the corresponding results from linear-response theory, the fourth-order coefficient is shown to diverge as the screening is made to vanish. For the bare Coulomb interaction we have not succeeded in obtaining analytical results, and, due to numerical problems at small-q vectors, our numerically obtained coefficients have an estimated uncertainty of 20\%.},

	abstract = {yambo is an ab initio code for calculating quasiparticle energies and optical properties of electronic systems within the framework of many-body perturbation theory and time-dependent density functional theory. Quasiparticle energies are calculated within the GW approximation for the self-energy. Optical properties are evaluated either by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation or by using the adiabatic local density approximation. yambo is a plane-wave code that, although particularly suited for calculations of periodic bulk systems, has been applied to a large variety of physical systems. yambo relies on efficient numerical techniques devised to treat systems with reduced dimensionality, or with a large number of degrees of freedom. The code has a user-friendly command-line based interface, flexible I/O procedures and is interfaced to several publicly available density functional ground-state codes.

In our setup, one of the electrodes serves as a probe (“STM tip”), which is weakly coupled to the system we want to measure. In the ideal STM limit of vanishing coupling to the tip, the system is restored to quasi-equilibrium and the normalized differential conductance yields the exact equilibrium many-body spectral function. Calculating this quantity from i-DFT, we derive an exact relation expressing the interacting spectral function in terms of the Kohn–Sham one.

	abstract = {The existence of band gaps in both the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and paramagnetic (PM) phases of the classic NaCl-structure Mott insulators MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO is traditionally viewed and taught as a manifestation of strong correlation whereby insulation results from electrons moving across the lattice forming states with doubly occupied d orbitals on certain atomic sites and empty d orbitals on other sites. Within such theories, the gap of the AFM and PM phases of these oxides emerges even in the absence of spatial symmetry breaking. The need for such a correlated picture is partially based on the known failure of the commonly used band models for the PM phase that assume for such a spin disordered state the macroscopically averaged NaCl structure, where all transition metal (TM) sites are symmetry-equivalent (a monomorphous description), producing a gapless PM state with zero magnetic moments, in sharp conflict with experiment. Here, we seek to understand the minimum theoretical description needed to capture the leading descriptors of ground state Mott insulation in the classic, 3d monoxide Mott systems—gapping and moment formation in the AFM and PM phase. As noted by previous authors, the spin-ordered AFM phase in these materials already shows in band theory a significant band gap when one doubles the NaCl unit cell by permitting different potentials for transition-metal atoms with different spins. For the spin-disordered PM phase, we allow analogously larger NaCl-type supercells where each TM site can have different spin direction and local bonding environments (i.e., disordered), yet the total spin is zero. Such a polymorphous description has the flexibility to acquire symmetry-breaking energy-lowering patterns that can lift the degeneracy of the d orbitals and develop large on-site magnetic moments without violating the global, averaged NaCl symmetry. Electrons are exchanged between spin-up and spin-down bands to create closed-shell insulating configurations that lend themselves to a single determinental description. It turns out that such a polymorphous description of the structure within the single-determinant, mean-field, Bloch periodic band structure approach (based on DFT+U) allows large on-site magnetic moments to develop spontaneously, leading to significant (1–3 eV) band gaps and large local moments in the AFM and PM phases of the classic NaCl-structure Mott insulators MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO in agreement with experiment. We adapt to the spin disordered polymorphous configurations the “special quasirandom structure” (SQS) construct known from the theory of disordered substitutional alloys whereby supercell approximants which represent the best random configuration average (not individual snapshots) for finite (64, 216 atoms, or larger) supercells of a given lattice symmetry are constructed. We conclude that the basic features of these paradigmatic Mott insulators can be approximated by the physics included in energy-lowering symmetry broken DFT.},

The concept is to generalise constrained density functional theory to free it from any assumptions about the spatial confinement of electrons and holes, but to maintain all the advantages of a variational method. The task of calculating the lowest excited state of a given symmetry is thereby simplified to one of performing a simple, low-cost sequence of coupled DFT calculations. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by calculating the lowest single-particle singlet and triplet excitation energies in the well-known Thiel molecular test set, with results which are in good agreement with linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT). Furthermore, we show that XDFT can successfully capture two-electron excitations, in principle, offering a flexible approach to target specific effects beyond state-of-the-art adiabatic-kernel LR-TDDFT. Overall the method makes optical gaps and electron-hole binding energies readily accessible at a computational cost and scaling comparable to that of standard density functional theory. Owing to its multiple qualities beneficial to high-throughput studies where the optical gap is of particular interest; namely broad applicability, low computational demand, and ease of implementation and automation, XDFT presents as a viable candidate for research within materials discovery and informatics frameworks.},

We propose an ad hoc orbital density functional (ODF) (with orbitals defined as Wannier functions) that by construction obeys this discontinuity condition. Taking its variation, the one-electron equations are obtained with a potential in the form of a projection operator. This operator increases the separation between occupied and empty bands, thus curing an LDA deficiency—systematic underestimation of the energy gap value. The minimization of the ODF gives the ground-state orbital and total electron densities. In addition to that we define the ODF fluctuation Hamiltonian that allows one to treat dynamical correlation effects. The dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method for an effective impurity problem was used to solve this Hamiltonian. We have applied the ODF method to the problem of the metal–insulator transition in lanthanum trihydride LaH3−x. In the LDA calculations for all values of hydrogen nonstoichiometry x the ground state of this material is metallic, while experimentally the system is insulating for x{\textless}0.3.

Then, the corrective approaches proposed to solve the DFT bandgap problem are reviewed, while comparing them in terms of accuracy and computational cost. The Hubbard model will then offer a simple approach to correctly describe the behavior of highly correlated materials, known as the Mott insulators. Based on Hubbard model, DFT+U scheme is built, which is computationally convenient for accurate calculations of electronic structures. Later in this chapter, the computational and semiempirical methods of optimizing the value of the Coulomb interaction potential (U) are discussed, while evaluating the conditions under which it can be most predictive.

In addition, here we generalize the entire formalism from norm-conserving to ultrasoft and projector-augmented wave formulations, and to metallic ground states.

	abstract = {The Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) can be applied to compute from first-principles optical spectra that include the effects of screened electron–hole interactions. As input, BSE calculations require single-particle states, quasiparticle energy levels, and the screened Coulomb interaction, which are typically obtained with many-body perturbation theory, whose cost limits the scope of possible applications. This work tries to address this practical limitation, instead deriving spectral energies from Koopmans-compliant functionals and introducing a new methodology for handling the screened Coulomb interaction. The explicit calculation of the W matrix is bypassed via a direct minimization scheme applied on top of a maximally localized Wannier function basis. We validate and benchmark this approach by computing the low-lying excited states of the molecules in Thiel’s set and the optical absorption spectrum of a C60 fullerene. The results show the same trends as quantum chemical methods and are in excellent agreement with previous simulations carried out at the time-dependent density functional theory or G0W0-BSE level. Conveniently, the new framework reduces the parameter space controlling the accuracy of the calculation, thereby simplifying the simulation of charge-neutral excitations, offering the potential to expand the applicability of first-principles spectroscopies to larger systems of applied interest.},

	abstract = {The electron-phonon interaction causes thermal and zero-point motion shifts of electron quasiparticle (QP) energies εk(T). Other consequences of interactions, visible in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, are broadening of QP peaks and appearance of sidebands, contained in the electron spectral function A(k,ω)=−ImGR(k,ω)/π, where GR is the retarded Green's function. Electronic structure codes (e.g., using density-functional theory) are now available that compute the shifts and start to address broadening and sidebands. Here we consider MgO and LiF, and determine their nonadiabatic Migdal self-energy. The spectral function obtained from the Dyson equation makes errors in the weight and energy of the QP peak and the position and weight of the phonon-induced sidebands. Only one phonon satellite appears, with an unphysically large energy difference (larger than the highest phonon energy) with respect to the QP peak. By contrast, the spectral function from a cumulant treatment of the same self-energy is physically better, giving a quite accurate QP energy and several satellites approximately spaced by the LO phonon energy. In particular, the positions of the QP peak and first satellite agree closely with those found for the Fröhlich Hamiltonian by Mishchenko et al. [Phys. Rev. B 62, 6317 (2000)] using diagrammatic Monte Carlo. We provide a detailed comparison between the first-principles MgO and LiF results and those of the Fröhlich Hamiltonian. Such an analysis applies widely to materials with infrared(IR)-active phonons.},

However, the virial of the correlation potential does not yield the correlation energy. We have recently constructed a “hypercorrelated” potential whose virial is the correlation energy. We apply these ideas to a system which contains two interacting electrons in an external harmonic potential, Hooke's atom. This system can be solved analytically for a set of spring constants and numerically for any spring constant. By inverting the Kohn–Sham equations, the exact exchange and correlation potentials can be found. These exact values are compared with several popular approximate functionals, namely local spin density (LSD), Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE), and Becke and Lee–Yang–Parr (BLYP). We illustrate our results for two values of the spring constant. At a moderate value, the density is comparable to the He atom, while for a low spring constant, we explore extremely low densities. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

For the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) hybrid family of exchange-correlation functionals (i.e., for an approximate generalized Kohn-Sham theory) this implies that (i) the highest occupied molecular orbital corresponds to the ionization potential (I), (ii) the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital corresponds to the electron affinity (A), and (iii) the energies of the frontier orbitals are constant as a function of their occupation. In agreement with a previous study [N. Sai et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 226403 (2011)], we find that these conditions are met for high values of the exact exchange admixture α and illustrate their importance for the tetrathiafulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane complex for which standard density functional theory functionals predict artificial electron transfer. We further assess the performance for atomization energies and weak interaction energies. We find that atomization energies are significantly underestimated compared to PBE or PBE0, whereas the description of weak interaction energies improves significantly if a 1/R6 van der Waals correction scheme is employed.},

We show that single-shot perturbation calculations in the G0W0 approximation, which are routinely used for valence states, cannot be applied for core levels and suffer from an extreme, erroneous transfer of spectral weight to the satellite spectrum. The correct behavior can be restored by partial self-consistent GW schemes or by using hybrid functionals with almost 50\% of exact exchange as a starting point for G0W0. We also include relativistic corrections and present a benchmark study for 65 molecular 1s excitations.

In order to simulate an M-particle excited state of an N-electron system, XDFT automatically optimizes a constraining potential to confine N-M electrons within the ground-state Kohn-Sham valence subspace. We demonstrate the efficacy of XDFT by calculating the lowest single-particle singlet and triplet excitation energies of the well-known Thiel molecular test set, with results which are in excellent agreement with time-dependent DFT. Furthermore, going beyond the capability of adiabatic time-dependent DFT, we show that XDFT can successfully capture double excitations. Overall our method makes optical gaps, excition bindings and oscillator strengths readily accessible at a computational cost comparable to that of standard DFT. As such, XDFT appears as an ideal candidate to work within high-throughput discovery frameworks and within linear-scaling methods for large systems.},

In what has become an increasingly standard approach, Kohn–Sham eigenenergies, generated from a DFT calculation with a strategically-chosen exchange–correlation functional “starting point”, are used to construct G and W, and then perturbatively corrected by the resultant GW self-energy. In practice, there are several ways to construct the GW self-energy, and these can lead to variations in predicted quasiparticle energies. For example, for ZnO and TiO2, the GW fundamental gaps reported in the literature can vary by more than 1 eV depending on the GW code used. In this work, we calculate and analyze GW quasiparticle (QP) energies of these and other systems with three different GW codes: BerkeleyGW, Abinit and Yambo. Through a systematic analysis of the GW implementation of these three codes, we identify the primary origin of major discrepancies between codes reported in prior literature to be the different implementations the Coulomb divergence in the Fock exchange term and the frequency integration scheme of the GW self-energy. We then eliminate these discrepancies by using common numerical methods and algorithms, demonstrating that the same quasiparticle energies for a given material can be obtained with different codes, within numerical differences ascribable to the technical details of the underling implementations.

	abstract = {Although the self-interaction terms in the Coulomb and exchange potentials exactly cancel each other in the Hartree-Fock one-electron Hamiltonian, the cancellation is incomplete when the exchange interaction is treated by the density-functional approximation. The residual self-interaction pushes the orbital energy levels upward. This effect is especially serious for valence states of insulators with localized charge distribution and causes an underestimation of the energy band gap. We have corrected for this incomplete cancellation of self-interaction in the density-functional formalism of energy-band theory of crystalline solids. The self-interaction correction (SIC) to the total energy of the N-electron system is expressed in terms of the Wannier functions, and periodic SIC potentials for the Bloch-state wave functions are derived variationally from the energy functional. The resulting SIC one-electron Hamiltonians are state dependent, but a unified Hamiltonian has been devised so that energies of all levels of the same →k from different bands are obtained by diagonalizing the same matrix. We have applied this SIC method to calculate the energy band structure of the argon and LiCl crystals. Using the Kohn-Sham exchange along with the correlation potential of von Barth and Hedin, we obtain band gaps in excellent agreement with experiment, whereas without SIC the calculated band gaps are more than 35\% below the experimental values.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The timing of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is a critical factor to understand the epidemic trajectory and the impact of isolation, contact tracing and other non- pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of COVID-19 epidemics. We examined the distribution of transmission events with respect to exposure and onset of symptoms. We show that for symptomatic individuals, the timing of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is more strongly linked to the onset of clinical symptoms of COVID-19 than to the time since infection. We found that it was approximately centered and symmetric around the onset of symptoms, with three quarters of events occurring in the window from 2-3 days before to 2-3 days after. However, we caution against overinterpretation of the right tail of the distribution, due to its dependence on behavioural factors and interventions. We also found that the pre-symptomatic infectious period extended further back in time for individuals with longer incubation periods. This strongly suggests that information about when a case was infected should be collected where possible, in order to assess how far into the past their contacts should be traced. Overall, the fraction of transmission from strictly pre-symptomatic infections was high (41\%; 95\%CI 31-50\%), which limits the efficacy of symptom-based interventions, and the large fraction of transmissions (35\%; 95\%CI 26-45\%) that occur on the same day or the day after onset of symptoms underlines the critical importance of individuals distancing themselves from others as soon as they notice any symptoms, even if they are mild. Rapid or at-home testing and contextual risk information would greatly facilitate efficient early isolation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Ground-state properties of solids have been extensively investigated for several decades within the standard density functional theory. Excited-state properties, on the other hand, were relatively unexplored in ab initio calculations until a decade ago. The most suitable approach up to now for studying excited-state properties of extended systems is the Green function method. To calculate the Green function one requires the self-energy operator which is non-local and energy dependent. In this article we describe the GW approximation which has turned out to be a fruitful approximation to the self-energy. The Green function theory, numerical methods for carrying out the self-energy calculations, simplified schemes, and applications to various systems are described. Self-consistency issue and new developments beyond the GW approximation are also discussed as well as the success and shortcomings of the GW approximation.},

In 1981, Perdew and Zunger (PZ) subtracted the fully nonlocal self-interaction error orbital-by-orbital, making the corrected functional exact for all collections of separated one-electron densities and making no correction to the exact functional. Although the PZ self-interaction correction (SIC) eliminates many errors of semilocal functionals, it is often worse for equilibrium properties of sp-bonded molecules and solids. Nonempirical semilocal functionals are usually designed to be exact for electron gases of uniform density and, thus, also make 0\% error for neutral atoms in the limit of large atomic number Z, but PZ SIC is not so designed. For localized SIC orbitals, we show analytically that the local spin density approximation (LSDA)-SIC correlation energy per electron of the uniform gas in the high-density limit makes an error of −50\% in the spin-unpolarized case and −100\% in the fully spin-polarized case. Then we extrapolate from the Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms to estimate the relative errors of the PZ SIC exchange-correlation energies (with localized SIC orbitals) in the limit of large atomic number: about +5.5\% for the LSDA-SIC and about −3.5\% for nonempirical generalized gradient [Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)-SIC] and meta-generalized gradient strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN)-SIC approximations. The SIC errors are considerably larger than those that have been estimated for LSDA-SIC by approximating the localized SIC orbitals for the uniform gas and may explain the errors of PZ SIC for equilibrium properties, opening the door to a generalized SIC that is more widely accurate.},

This provides a variational derivation of the equation for the exact exchange-correlation potential that was derived by Sham and Schlüter using a density condition.

Instead, combinations must be used, leading both to continuous absorption as in the energy bands, and to one or two discrete lines in connection with each continuum, as in absorption by independent atoms or in excitation waves. These conclusions are compared with experiment, explaining in a general way the sharp structure observed both in the near and far ultraviolet absorption spectra of these crystals.

At the same time, high-throughput (HT) computational materials design is an emergent field that promises to accelerate reliable and cost-effective design and optimisation of new materials with target properties. The use of MLWFs in HT workflows has been hampered by the fact that generating MLWFs automatically and robustly without any user intervention and for arbitrary materials is, in general, very challenging. We address this problem directly by proposing a procedure for automatically generating MLWFs for HT frameworks. Our approach is based on the selected columns of the density matrix method and we present the details of its implementation in an AiiDA workflow. We apply our approach to a dataset of 200 bulk crystalline materials that span a wide structural and chemical space. We assess the quality of our MLWFs in terms of the accuracy of the band-structure interpolation that they provide as compared to the band-structure obtained via full first-principles calculations. Finally, we provide a downloadable virtual machine that can be used to reproduce the results of this paper, including all first-principles and atomistic simulations as well as the computational workflows.},

	abstract = {It is shown how to properly construct exchange-correlation (xc) potentials in the Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory such that physically meaningful KS eigenvalues result. A potential adjustor ΔN−Hxc is derived which enables for any approximate functional for the xc energy the construction of a consistent xc potential leading to an eigenvalue of the energetically highest occupied KS orbital equal to the negative of the ionization potential. Together with a second potential adjustor ΔN+Hxc KS band structures can be converted in approximate quasiparticle band structures exhibiting the exact physical instead of the KS band gap. This represents an alternative route to the fundamental quasiparticle band gap, completely within the KS formalism without the need to resort to many-body perturbation theory approaches like the GW method. It is shown that, for any finite system, approximate xc potentials including those in the local density and generalized gradient approximations, in contrast to common belief, always exhibit consistent nonzero discontinuities at integer electron numbers, if constructed properly. Thus the discontinuity of xc potentials is identified as a derived quantity which emerges automatically by properly constructing xc potentials without the need to be specifically incorporated in approximate xc functionals. It is demonstrated that all relevant objects of the ensemble KS formalism, in particular functional derivatives and their discontinuities, can be expressed in terms of quantities readily available in the KS formalism of integer electron numbers within an approach named integer electron ensemble approach (IEEA). Attempts to specifically construct ensemble density functionals are shown to be needless. Taking the known asymptotic behavior of the electron density into account an internal consistency condition for xc potentials is presented which justifies tuning procedures of xc functionals and, furthermore, indicates how asymptotic corrections for xc potentials have to be properly employed.},

Here, we propose an approximation to the TDDFT exchange-correlation kernel which is nonadiabatic and nonlocal. It is extracted from correlated calculations in the homogeneous electron gas, where we have tabulated it for a wide range of wave vectors and frequencies. A simple mean density approximation allows one to use it in inhomogeneous materials where the density varies on a scale of 1.6 rs or faster. This kernel contains effects that are completely absent in the ALDA; in particular, it correctly describes the double plasmon in the dynamic structure factor of sodium, and it shows the characteristic low-energy peak that appears in systems with low electronic density. It also leads to an overall quantitative improvement of spectra.},

These regression models can subsequently predict impurity properties in mixed anion CdX compounds (where X is a combination of Te, Se and S) fairly accurately, proving that although trained only on the end points, they are applicable to intermediate compositions. We make machine-learned predictions of the Fermi-level-dependent formation energies of hundreds of possible impurities in 5 chalcogenide compounds, and we suggest a list of impurities which can shift the equilibrium Fermi level in the semiconductor as determined by the dominant intrinsic defects. Machine learning predictions for the dominating impurities compare well with DFT predictions, revealing the power of machine-learned models in the quick screening of impurities likely to affect the optoelectronic behavior of semiconductors.},

	abstract = {The flat-plane condition is the union of two exact constraints in electronic structure theory: (i) energetic piecewise linearity with fractional electron removal or addition and (ii) invariant energetics with change in electron spin in a half filled orbital. Semi-local density functional theory (DFT) fails to recover the flat plane, exhibiting convex fractional charge errors (FCE) and concave fractional spin errors (FSE) that are related to delocalization and static correlation errors. We previously showed that DFT+U eliminates FCE but now demonstrate that, like other widely employed corrections (i.e., Hartree-Fock exchange), it worsens FSE. To find an alternative strategy, we examine the shape of semi-local DFT deviations from the exact flat plane and we find this shape to be remarkably consistent across ions and molecules. We introduce the judiciously modified DFT (jmDFT) approach, wherein corrections are constructed from few-parameter, low-order functional forms that fit the shape of semi-local DFT errors. We select one such physically intuitive form and incorporate it self-consistently to correct semi-local DFT. We demonstrate on model systems that jmDFT represents the first easy-to-implement, no-overhead approach to recovering the flat plane from semi-local DFT.},

	abstract = {The question of which non-interacting Green’s function ‘best’ describes an interacting many-body electronic system is both of fundamental interest as well as of practical importance in describing electronic properties of materials in a realistic manner. Here, we study this question within the framework of Baym–Kadanoff theory, an approach where one locates the stationary point of a total energy functional of the one-particle Green’s function in order to find the total ground-state energy as well as all one-particle properties such as the density matrix, chemical potential, or the quasiparticle energy spectrum and quasiparticle wave functions. For the case of the Klein functional, our basic finding is that minimizing the length of the gradient of the total energy functional over non-interacting Green’s functions yields a set of self-consistent equations for quasiparticles that is identical to those of the quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW) (van Schilfgaarde et al 2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 226402–4) approach, thereby providing an a priori justification for such an approach to electronic structure calculations. In fact, this result is general, applies to any self-energy operator, and is not restricted to any particular approximation, e.g., the GW approximation for the self-energy. The approach also shows that, when working in the basis of quasiparticle states, solving the diagonal part of the self-consistent Dyson equation is of primary importance while the off-diagonals are of secondary importance, a common observation in the electronic structure literature of self-energy calculations. Finally, numerical tests and analytical arguments show that when the Dyson equation produces multiple quasiparticle solutions corresponding to a single non-interacting state, minimizing the length of the gradient translates into choosing the solution with largest quasiparticle weight.},

	abstract = {Calculations of charged systems in periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are problematic because there are spurious interactions between the charges in different periodic images that can affect the physical picture. In addition, the intuitive limit of Coulomb interactions decaying to zero as the interacting charges are placed at infinite separation no longer applies, and for example total energies become undefined. Leveraging subsystem density functional theory (also known as density embedding) we define an impurity model that embeds a finite neutral or charged subsystem within an extended (infinite) surrounding subsystem. The combination of the impurity model and a consistent choice of the Coulomb reference provides us with an algorithm for evaluating the ionization potential (IP) in extended systems. We demonstrate our approach in a pilot calculation of the IP of liquid water, based on a configuration from a prior ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation of liquid water (Genova et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 144, 234105). The calculations with the impurity model capture the broadening on the ionization energies introduced by the interactions between the water molecules. Furthermore, the calculated average IP value (10.5 eV) compare favorably to experiments (9.9-10.06 eV) and very recent simulations based on the GW approximation (10.55 eV), while at the same time outperforming density embedding calculations carried out with a naïve handling of the electrostatic interactions (about 7 eV).},

In this paper, we present an efficient approach to compute the RPA correlation energy in the framework of the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation formalism. The method is based on the calculation of a relatively small number of eigenmodes of RPA dielectric matrix, efficiently computed by iterative density response calculations in the framework of density functional perturbation theory. We will also discuss a careful treatment of the integrable divergence in the exact-exchange energy calculation which alleviates the problem of its slow convergence with respect to Brillouin-zone sampling.

Density functional theory (DFT) is now routinely used for simulating material properties. Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best to use for a specific calculation. Lejaeghere et al. compared the calculated values for the equation of states for 71 elemental crystals from 15 different widely used DFT codes employing 40 different potentials (see the Perspective by Skylaris). Although there were variations in the calculated values, most recent codes and methods converged toward a single value, with errors comparable to those of experiment.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONThe reproducibility of results is one of the underlying principles of science. An observation can only be accepted by the scientific community when it can be confirmed by independent studies. However, reproducibility does not come easily. Recent works have painfully exposed cases where previous conclusions were not upheld. The scrutiny of the scientific community has also turned to research involving computer programs, finding that reproducibility depends more strongly on implementation than commonly thought. These problems are especially relevant for property predictions of crystals and molecules, which hinge on precise computer implementations of the governing equation of quantum physics.
RATIONALEThis work focuses on density functional theory (DFT), a particularly popular quantum method for both academic and industrial applications. More than 15,000 DFT papers are published each year, and DFT is now increasingly used in an automated fashion to build large databases or apply multiscale techniques with limited human supervision. Therefore, the reproducibility of DFT results underlies the scientific credibility of a substantial fraction of current work in the natural and engineering sciences. A plethora of DFT computer codes are available, many of them differing considerably in their details of implementation, and each yielding a certain “precision” relative to other codes. How is one to decide for more than a few simple cases which code predicts the correct result, and which does not? We devised a procedure to assess the precision of DFT methods and used this to demonstrate reproducibility among many of the most widely used DFT codes. The essential part of this assessment is a pairwise comparison of a wide range of methods with respect to their predictions of the equations of state of the elemental crystals. This effort required the combined expertise of a large group of code developers and expert users.
RESULTSWe calculated equation-of-state data for four classes of DFT implementations, totaling 40 methods. Most codes agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Even in the case of pseudization approaches, which largely depend on the atomic potentials used, a similar precision can be obtained as when using the full potential. The remaining deviations are due to subtle effects, such as specific numerical implementations or the treatment of relativistic terms.
CONCLUSIONOur work demonstrates that the precision of DFT implementations can be determined, even in the absence of one absolute reference code. Although this was not the case 5 to 10 years ago, most of the commonly used codes and methods are now found to predict essentially identical results. The established precision of DFT codes not only ensures the reproducibility of DFT predictions but also puts several past and future developments on a firmer footing. Any newly developed methodology can now be tested against the benchmark to verify whether it reaches the same level of precision. New DFT applications can be shown to have used a sufficiently precise method. Moreover, high-precision DFT calculations are essential for developing improvements to DFT methodology, such as new density functionals, which may further increase the predictive power of the simulations. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/351/6280/aad3000/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Recent DFT methods yield reproducible results.Whereas older DFT implementations predict different values (red darts), codes have now evolved to mutual agreement (green darts). The scoreboard illustrates the good pairwise agreement of four classes of DFT implementations (horizontal direction) with all-electron results (vertical direction). Each number reflects the average difference between the equations of state for a given pair of methods, with the green-to-red color scheme showing the range from the best to the poorest agreement.
The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements.

	abstract = {An effective fractional-spin correction is developed to describe static/strong correlation in density functional theory. Combined with the fractional-charge correction from recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC), a functional, the fractional-spin LOSC (FSLOSC), is proposed. FSLOSC, a correction to commonly used functional approximations, introduces the explicit derivative discontinuity and largely restores the flat-plane behavior of electronic energy at fractional charges and fractional spins. In addition to improving results from conventional functionals for the prediction of ionization potentials, electron affinities, quasiparticle spectra, and reaction barrier heights, FSLOSC properly describes the dissociation of ionic species, single bonds, and multiple bonds without breaking space or spin symmetry and corrects the spurious fractional-charge dissociation of heteroatom molecules of conventional functionals. Thus, FSLOSC demonstrates success in reducing delocalization error and including strong correlation, within low-cost density functional approximation.},

Q[ρ] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Ψρ which yield the fixed. ρ. Q[ρ] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron—electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix γ, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree—Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

This condition explains why the highest-occupied orbital energies of Hartree-Fock and exact exchange OEP are so close. More importantly, we show that the exact OEP can be constructed iteratively from the first-order shifts of the Kohn-Sham orbitals and that these can be calculated easily. The exact exchange potential vx(r) for spherical atoms and three-dimensional sodium clusters is calculated. Its long-range asymptotic behavior is investigated, including the approach of vx(r) to a nonvanishing constant in particular spatial directions. We calculate total and orbital energies and static electric dipole polarizabilities for the sodium clusters employing the exact exchange functional.

While the generation of an effective mass and a band gap at the Dirac point remains an unresolved problem for freestanding extended graphene, it is well established by breaking translational symmetry by confinement and by breaking sublattice symmetry by interaction with a substrate. One of the strongest sublattice-symmetry-breaking interactions with predicted and measured band gaps ranging from 400 meV to more than 3 eV has been attributed to the interfaces of graphene with Ni and Co, which are also promising spin-filter interfaces. Here, we apply angle-resolved photoemission to epitaxial graphene on Ni(111) and Co(0001) to show the presence of intact Dirac cones 2.8 eV below the Fermi level. Our results challenge the common belief that the breaking of sublattice symmetry by a substrate and the opening of the band gap at the Dirac energy are in a straightforward relation. A simple effective model of a biased bilayer structure composed of graphene and a sublattice-symmetry-broken layer, corroborated by density-functional-theory calculations, demonstrates the general validity of our conclusions.},

	abstract = {In the Kohn-Sham density functional method [1, 2, 3, 4], the true interactingelectron system is replaced by a system of non-interacting electrons in an effective potential, veff , defined by the requirement that the density of the non-interacting electrons equals the true density. The single particle orbitals and their eigenenergies were originally introduced as a mathematical artifact in order to achieve a good approximation to the kinetic energy, leaving only a relatively small term, the exchange-correlation energy Exc, to be approximated in practical implementations of the theory. It was later shown [5] that the energy of the highest occupied orbital is in fact the negative of the ionization energy. However, most approximate functionals (such as the commonly used local density approximation [2, 3, 4]) yield poor approximations to it. The energies of the other occupied orbitals and of the unoccupied orbitals do not have a rigorous correspondence to excitation energies. Nevertheless, it is common practice to compare eigenvalue differences to optical spectra of molecules and solids. Since these comparisons are made using Kohn-Sham eigenvalues obtained from approximate exchange-correlation functionals, it is not clear how much of the discrepancy between theory and experiment would persist if the true Kohn-Sham eigenvalues were to be used. In this paper we show that there is a surprising degree of agreement between the exact ground-state Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences and excitation energies, for excitations from the highest occupied orbital to the unoccupied orbitals.},

	abstract = {In the exact theory, the ground state energy of an open system varies linearly when the electron number is changed between two adjacent integers. This linear dependence is not reproduced by common approximate density functionals. Deviation from linearity in this dependence has been suggested as a basis for the concept of many-electron self-interaction error (SIE). In this paper, we quantify many-electron SIE of a number of approximations by performing calculations on fractionally charged atoms. We demonstrate the direct relevance of these studies to such problems of common approximate functionals as instabilities of anions, spurious fractional charges on dissociated atoms, and poor description of charge transfer. Semilocal approximations have the largest many-electron SIE, which is only slightly reduced in typical global hybrids. In these approximations the energy versus fractional electron number curves upward, while in Hartree-Fock theory the energy curves downward. Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction [Phys. Rev. B 23, 5048 (1981)] significantly reduces the many-electron SIE of semilocal functionals but impairs their accuracy for equilibrium properties. In contrast, a long-range corrected hybrid functional can be nearly many-electron SIE-free in many cases (for reasons we discuss) and at the same time performs remarkably well for many molecular properties.},

Moreover, for semi-local density functionals, we show that the piecewise convexity of the E(N) curve, as stated in the literature, is not generally true for all fractions. By an analysis based on exchange-only local density approximation and careful examination of the E(N) curve, we find for some systems, there exists a very small concave region, corresponding to adding a small fraction of electrons to the integer system, while the remaining E(N) curve is convex. Several numerical examples are provided as verification. Although the E(N) curve is not convex everywhere in these systems, the previous conclusions on the consequence of the delocalization error in the commonly used density functional approximations, in particular, the underestimation of ionization potential, and the overestimation of electron affinity, and other related issues, remain unchanged. This suggests that instead of using the term convexity, a modified and more rigorous description for the delocalization error is that the E(N) curve lies below the straight line segment across the neighboring integer points for these approximate functionals.},

We argue that Janak's extension of this relation to (exact) Kohn–Sham density functional theory is not valid. The reason is the nonexistence of systems with noninteger electron number, and therefore of the derivative of the total energy with respect to electron number, ∂E/∂N. How to handle the lack of a defined derivative ∂E/∂N at the integer point, is demonstrated using the Lagrange multiplier technique to enforce constraints.

Lett. 49, 1691 (1982)] for the average energy of a molecule in a macroscopic sample (‘dilute gas’) as a function of average electron number is not a property of a single molecule at T=0. One may choose to represent the energy of a molecule in the nonphysical domain of noninteger densities by a straight-line functional, but the arbitrariness of this choice precludes the drawing of physical conclusions from it.},

For these materials, we generate ab initio pseudopotentials treating as valence states the outermost two shells of atomic orbitals, rather than only the outermost valence shell as in traditional pseudopotential calculations. The resulting direct and indirect energy gaps are compared with experimental measurements and with previous calculations based on pseudopotential and “all-electron” approaches. Our results show that, contrary to recent claims, self-energy effects due to semicore states on the band gaps can be well accounted for in the standard valence-only pseudopotential formalism.},

	abstract = {Charge carrier localization in extended atomic systems has been described previously as being driven by disorder, point defects, or distortions of the ionic lattice. Here we show for the first time by means of first-principles computations that charge carriers can spontaneously localize due to a purely electronic effect in otherwise perfectly ordered structures. Optimally tuned range-separated density functional theory and many-body perturbation calculations within the GW approximation reveal that in trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene the hole density localizes on a length scale of several nanometers. This is due to exchange-induced translational symmetry breaking of the charge density. Ionization potentials, optical absorption peaks, excitonic binding energies, and the optimally tuned range parameter itself all become independent of polymer length as it exceeds the critical localization length. Moreover, we find that lattice disorder and the formation of a polaron result from the charge localization in contrast to the traditional view that lattice distortions precede charge localization. Our results can explain experimental findings that polarons in conjugated polymers form instantaneously after exposure to ultrafast light pulses.},

This represents a significant improvement at comparable efficiency over its predecessors, the GGAs that currently dominate materials computation. Often, SCAN matches or improves on the accuracy of a computationally expensive hybrid functional, at almost-GGA cost.

It makes the supercell energy bands more crowded. The crowded energy bands are outright difficult, if not impossible, to be compared with experimental results directly. Besides, the intra-supercell translation symmetries are hidden in the supercell band structure calculations. In order to compare with experiments and catch the hidden symmetries, we have to unfold the supercell energy bands into the corresponding primary-cell Brillouin zone. Solution method: The electron wavefunction is reconstructed from Wannier functions and Hamiltonian parameters, which are produced by Wannier90 package. Then by using fast Fourier transformation (FFT), we get the Fourier components of the reconstructed wavefunction. The unfolding weight is calculated from the Fourier components, based on group theory and its special form for plane-wave basis. Unusual features: Simple and user-friendly input system.

	abstract = {Many observables such as the density, total energy, or electric current, can be expressed explicitly in terms of the one-body Green's function, which describes electron addition or removal to or from a system. An efficient way to determine such a Green's function is to introduce a self-energy, which is a nonlocal and dynamic effective potential that influences the propagation of particles in an interacting system. The state-of-the art approximation for the self-energy is the GW approximation, where the system to (or from) which the electron is added (or removed) is described as a polarizable, screening, medium. This is expressed by the name of the approximation: ‘GW’ stands for the one-body Green's function G and for W, the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction. The GW approximation is very popular for the calculation of band structures in solids, and increasingly used also to describe nanostructures, clusters, and molecules. As compared to static mean-field approximations for the effective potential, the dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction in GW leads to a renormalization of energies, to broadening and/or to the observation of additional excitations. An analysis of the approximations that lead to the GW self-energy, and of the underlying picture, explains the successes and the limitations of the approach.

Most present-day methods in computational chemistry begin by calculating the molecular orbitals of the system. To what extent have these mathematical objects analogues in the real world? To shed light on this intriguing question, we employ a photoemission tomography study on monolayers of 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (PTCDA) grown on three Ag surfaces. The characteristic photoelectron angular distribution enables us to assign individual molecular orbitals to the emission features. When comparing the resulting energy positions to density functional calculations, we observe deviations in the energy ordering. By performing complete active space calculations (CASSCF), we can explain the experimentally observed orbital ordering, suggesting the importance of static electron correlation beyond a (semi)local approximation. On the other hand, our results also show reality and robustness of the orbital concept, thereby making molecular orbitals accessible to experimental observations.},

It is shown that the G0W0 approximation always yields too small band gaps. To improve agreement with experiment, the eigenvalues in the Green’s function G (GW0) and in the Green’s function and the dielectric matrix (GW) are updated until self-consistency is reached. The first approximation leads to excellent agreement with experiment, whereas an update of the eigenvalues in G and W gives too large band gaps for virtually all materials. From a pragmatic point of view, the GW0 approximation thus seems to be an accurate and still reasonably fast method for predicting quasiparticle energies in simple sp-bonded systems. We furthermore observe that the band gaps in materials with shallow d states (GaAs, GaN, and ZnO) are systematically underestimated. We propose that an inaccurate description of the static dielectric properties of these materials is responsible for the underestimation of the band gaps in GW0, which is itself a result of the incomplete cancellation of the Hartree self-energy within the d shell by local or gradient corrected density functionals.},

The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWF in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWF can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90 is able to output MLWF for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. wannier90 is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

	abstract = {wannier90  is a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWFs in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90  is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWFs can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90  is able to output MLWFs for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. We present here an updated version of wannier90, wannier90  2.0, including minor bug fixes and parallel (MPI) execution for band-structure interpolation and the calculation of properties such as density of states, Berry curvature and orbital magnetisation. wannier90  is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

Unlike graphene—which shows a wavelength-independent absorbance for visible light—the electronic bandgap, and therefore the optical response, of graphene nanoribbons changes with ribbon width. Here we report on the optical properties of armchair graphene nanoribbons of width N=7 grown on metal surfaces. Reflectance difference spectroscopy in combination with ab initio calculations show that ultranarrow graphene nanoribbons have fully anisotropic optical properties dominated by excitonic effects that sensitively depend on the exact atomic structure. For N=7 armchair graphene nanoribbons, the optical response is dominated by absorption features at 2.1, 2.3 and 4.2 eV, in excellent agreement with ab initio calculations, which also reveal an absorbance of more than twice the one of graphene for linearly polarized light in the visible range of wavelengths.},

We report the synthesis of an armchair graphene nanoribbon with a width of nine carbon atoms on Au(111) through surface-assisted aryl–aryl coupling and subsequent cyclodehydrogenation of a properly chosen molecular precursor. By combining high-resolution atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the atomic structure of the fabricated ribbons is exactly as designed. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and Fourier-transformed scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveal an electronic band gap of 1.4 eV and effective masses of ≈0.1 me for both electrons and holes, constituting a substantial improvement over previous efforts toward the development of transistor applications. We use ab initio calculations to gain insight into the dependence of the Raman spectra on excitation wavelength as well as to rationalize the symmetry-dependent contribution of the ribbons’ electronic states to the tunneling current. We propose a simple rule for the visibility of frontier electronic bands of armchair graphene nanoribbons in scanning tunneling spectroscopy.},

Functionalities far beyond those known from extended graphene systems include electronic band gap variations related to quantum confinement and edge effects, as well as localized spin-polarized edge states for specific edge geometries. The inability to produce graphene nanostructures with the needed precision, however, has so far hampered the verification of the predicted electronic properties. Here, we report on the electronic band gap and dispersion of the occupied electronic bands of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons fabricated via on-surface synthesis. Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy data from armchair graphene nanoribbons of width N = 7 supported on Au(111) reveal a band gap of 2.3 eV, an effective mass of 0.21 m0 at the top of the valence band, and an energy-dependent charge carrier velocity reaching 8.2 × 105 m/s in the linear part of the valence band. These results are in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions that include image charge corrections accounting for screening by the metal substrate and confirm the importance of electron–electron interactions in graphene nanoribbons.},

We find excellent agreement, with a mean absolute error of 0.20 eV for the KIPZ functional on the first ionization potential, which is state-of-the-art for both density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations and many-body perturbation theory. We highlight similarities and differences between KC functionals and other electronic-structure approaches, such as dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals and Green’s function methods, both from a theoretical and from a practical point of view, arguing that KC potentials can be considered as local and orbital-dependent approximations to the electronic self-energy, already including approximate vertex corrections.},

There is a marked difference between the coupling of the vibrational state to the valence band maximum and to the conduction band minimum. The strength of phonon coupling to the valence band maximum is similar between the three systems and is dominated by vibrations that change the bond length. The coupling strength to the conduction band minimum differs significantly in diamond, silicon carbide, and silicon. In diamond, the coupling is dominated by six small pockets of vibrational states in the phonon Brillouin zone that are ultimately responsible for the stronger electron-phonon coupling in this material. Our results represent a first step towards the development of an a priori understanding of electron-phonon coupling in semiconductors and insulators that should aid the design of materials with tailored electron-phonon coupling properties.},

A simplifying approximation allowing the use of real canonical orbitals is proposed. The algorithm is based on two-step self-consistent field iterations, where the updates of the canonical orbitals and the optimal orbitals are done separately. Calculations of the energy of atoms ranging from H to Ar are presented, using various generalized gradient functionals (PBE, APBE, PBEsol) and a meta-generalized gradient functional (TPSS). While the energy of atoms is poorly described by PBEsol, which is a functional optimized to reproduce properties of solids, the PZ-SIC brings the calculations into good agreement with the best ab initio estimates. The importance of using complex optimal orbitals becomes particularly clear in calculations using the TPSS functional, where the original functional gives good results while the application of PZ-SIC with real orbitals gives highly inaccurate results. With complex optimal orbitals, PZ-SIC slightly improves the accuracy of the TPSS functional. The charge localization problem that plagues Kohn–Sham DFT functionals, including hybrid functionals, is illustrated by calculations on the CH3 + F– complex, where even PBEsol with PZ-SIC is found to give estimates of both energy and charge with accuracy comparable to that of coupled cluster calculations.},

Advanced GW techniques, which include many-body effects as perturbative corrections, are hardly consistent with each other, predicting the band gap of phosphorene with a spread of almost 1 eV, from 1.6 to 2.4 eV. Our QMC results, from infinite periodic superlattices as well as from finite clusters, predict Δf to be about 2.4 eV, indicating that available GW results are systematically underestimating the gap. Using the recently uncovered universal scaling between the exciton binding energy and Δf, we predict the optical gap of about 1.7 eV that can be directly related to measurements even on encapsulated samples due to its robustness against dielectric environment. The QMC gaps are indeed consistent with recent experiments based on optical absorption and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. We also predict the cohesion of phosphorene to be only slightly smaller than that of the bulk crystal. Our investigations not only benchmark GW methods and experiments, but also open the field of 2D electronic structure to computationally intensive but highly predictive QMC methods which include many-body effects such as electronic correlations and van der Waals interactions explicitly.},

We have also calculated the frequency-dependent U for some of the materials. The strong frequency dependence of U in some of the cases considered in this paper suggests that the static value of U may not be the most appropriate one to use in model calculations. We have also made comparison with the constrained local density approximation (LDA) method and found some discrepancies in a number of cases. We emphasize that our scheme and the constrained local density approximation LDA method theoretically ought to give similar results and the discrepancies may be attributed to technical difficulties in performing calculations based on currently implemented constrained LDA schemes.},

Apart from some mild exceptions, the properties are very well described, particularly in weakly correlated cases.

	abstract = {The question of which non-interacting Green's function "best" describes an interacting many-body electronic system is both of fundamental interest as well as of practical importance in describing electronic properties of materials in a realistic manner. Here, we study this question within the framework of Luttinger-Ward theory, an approach where one extremizes a total energy functional of the one-particle Green's function in order to find the total ground-state energy as well as all one-particle properties such as the density matrix, chemical potential, or the quasiparticle energy spectrum and quasiparticle wave functions. Our basic finding is that minimizing the length of the gradient of the total energy functional over non-interacting Green's functions yields a set of self-consistent equations for quasiparticles that is identical to those of the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) approach, thereby providing an a priori justification for such an approach to electronic structure calculations. In fact, this result is general, applies to any self-energy operator, and is not restricted to any particular approximation, e.g. the GW approximation for the self-energy. The approach also naturally shows why solving the diagonal part of the self-consistent equations is of primary importance while the off-diagonals are of secondary importance, a common prior observation in the literature of electronic structure calculations based on self-energy calculations.},

For aperiodic systems the exact electrostatic energy functional in periodic boundary conditions is obtained. The convergence in such systems is considered in the limit of large supercells, where, in the gas phase, the computational effort is proportional to the volume. It is shown that for neutral localized aperiodic systems in either the gas or condensed phases, the energy can always be made to converge as O(L−5) where L is the linear dimension of the supercell. For charged systems, convergence at this rate can be achieved after adding correction terms to the energy to account for spurious interactions induced by the periodic boundary conditions.

The full dielectric matrix is used to evaluate the self-energy operator in the GW approximation: the first term in an expansion of the self-energy operator in terms of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction (W) and the dressed Green’s function (G). Quasiparticle energies are calculated for the homopolar materials diamond, Si, and Ge as well as for the ionic compound LiCl. The results are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. In particular, the indirect band gap is calculated as 5.5, 1.29, and 0.75 eV as compared with experimental gaps of 5.48, 1.17, and 0.744 eV for diamond, Si, and Ge, respectively. The Ge results include relativistic effects. The calculated direct gap for LiCl is within 5\% of experiment. Viewed as a correction to the density-functional eigenvalues calculated with the local-density approximation, the present results show a correction dominated by a large jump at the gap. It is found that because of the charge inhomogeneity, the full dielectric screening matrix must be included, i.e., local-field effects are essential. The dynamical effects are also found to be crucial. The required dielectric matrices are obtained within the density-functional approach for the static case and extended to finite frequency with use of a generalized plasmon-pole model based on sum rules. The model reproduces the ω and ω−1 moments of the exact many-body response function. The qualitative features of the electron self-energy operator are discussed. Using the static Coulomb-hole–screened-exchange approximation for illustration, the role of local fields in the self-energy operator are explained. The role of dynamical renormalization is illustrated. The same qualitative features are observed in both the homopolar and ionic materials.},

The potential difference is applied as a perturbation to the conduction-band states from a Kohn-Sham calculation with the local-density approximation, and a scissors-type band-gap correction is then obtained in a simple and efficient manner.

We demonstrate that the Madelung correction already brings a large potential shift that slowly converges as 1/L with increasing supercell sizes. We hence define a potential alignment devoid of any double counting. We finally propose a simple evaluation for the nearest-neighbor interaction that removes the remaining spurious hybridization of the defect wave functions between images. The application of these three corrections together drastically speeds up the convergence with respect to supercell size for all defects that are not too shallow.},

Tight-binding models based on the maximally localized Wannier functions obtained from different systems are often combined to construct tight-binding models for large systems such as a semi-infinite surface. However, the corresponding maximally localized Wannier functions in the overlapping region of different systems are not identical, and this discrepancy can introduce serious artifacts to the combined tight-binding model. Here, we propose two methods to seamlessly stitch two different tight-binding models that share some basis functions in common. First, we introduce a simple and efficient method: (i) finding the best matching maximally localized Wannier function pairs in the overlapping region belonging to the two tight-binding models, (ii) rotating the spin orientations of the two corresponding Wannier functions to make them parallel to each other, and (iii) making their overall phases equal. Second, we propose a more accurate and generally applicable method based on the iterative minimization of the difference between the Hamiltonian matrix elements in the overlapping region. We demonstrate our methods by applying them to the surfaces of diamond, GeTe, Bi\$\_2\$Se\$\_3\$, and TaAs. Our methods can be readily used to construct reliable tight-binding models for surfaces, interfaces, and defects.},

	abstract = {Semi-local approximations to the density functional for the exchange-correlation energy of a many-electron system necessarily fail for lobed one-electron densities, including not only the familiar stretched densities but also the less familiar but closely-related noded ones. The Perdew-Zunger (PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) to a semi-local approximation makes that approximation exact for all one-electron ground- or excited-state densities and accurate for stretched bonds. When the minimization of the PZ total energy is made over real localized orbitals, the orbital densities can be noded, leading to energy errors in many-electron systems. Minimization over complex localized orbitals yields nodeless orbital densities, which reduce but typically do not eliminate the SIC errors of atomization energies. Other errors of PZ SIC remain, attributable to the loss of the exact constraints and appropriate norms that the semi-local approximations satisfy, and suggesting the need for a generalized SIC. These conclusions are supported by calculations for one-electron densities, and for many-electron molecules. While PZ SIC raises and improves the energy barriers of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) and meta-GGA's, it reduces and often worsens the atomization energies of molecules. Thus PZ SIC raises the energy more as the nodality of the valence localized orbitals increases from atoms to molecules to transition states. PZ SIC is applied here in particular to the SCAN meta-GGA, for which the correlation part is already self-interaction-free. That property makes SCAN a natural first candidate for a generalized SIC.},

The functional contains two parameters, the range separation and the short-range Fock fraction. Both are determined nonempirically, per system, on the basis of the satisfaction of exact physical constraints for the ionization potential and frontier-orbital many-electron self-interaction, respectively. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated on four important benchmark organic molecules: perylene, pentacene, 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic-dianydride (PTCDA), and 1,4,5,8-naphthalene-tetracarboxylic-dianhydride (NTCDA).

Thus we emphasize the need to surpass this limit and shed light on the many-electron SIE. After identifying the sufficient condition for functionals to be free from SIE, we focus on the symptoms and investigate the performance of most popular functionals.

In this article, we take a new look at the deviation from linearity (i.e., curvature) in the solid-state limit by considering two different ways of approaching it: a large finite system of increasing size and a crystal represented by an increasingly large reference cell with periodic boundary conditions. We show that the curvature approaches vanishing values in both limits, even for functionals which yield poor predictions of electronic structure, and therefore cannot be used as a diagnostic or constructive tool in solids. We find that the approach towards zero curvature is different in each of the two limits, owing to the presence of a compensating background charge in the periodic case. Based on these findings, we present a new criterion for functional construction and evaluation, derived from the size-dependence of the curvature, along with a practical method for evaluating this criterion. For large finite systems, we further show that the curvature is dominated by the self-interaction of the highest occupied eigenstate. These findings are illustrated by computational studies of various solids, semiconductor nanocrystals, and long alkane chains.},

It exhibits a predominantly quadratic energy-density curve that is amenable to correction using efficient, constraint-resembling methods such as DFT + Hubbard U (DFT+U). Constrained DFT (cDFT) enforces conditions on DFT exactly, by means of self-consistently optimized Lagrange multipliers, and while its use to automate error corrections is a compelling possibility, we show that it is limited by a fundamental incompatibility with constraints beyond linear order. We circumvent this problem by utilizing separate linear and quadratic correction terms, which may be interpreted either as distinct constraints, each with its own Hubbard U type Lagrange multiplier, or as the components of a generalized DFT+U functional. The latter approach prevails in our tests on a model one-electron system, H2+, in that it readily recovers the exact total energy while symmetry-preserving pure constraints fail to do so. The generalized DFT+U functional moreover enables the simultaneous correction of the total energy and ionization potential, or the correction of either together with the enforcement of Koopmans' condition. For the latter case, we outline a practical, approximate scheme by which the required pair of Hubbard parameters, denoted as U1 and U2, may be calculated from first principles.},

	abstract = {Electronic excitations lie at the origin of most of the commonly measured spectra. However, the first-principles computation of excited states requires a larger effort than ground-state calculations, which can be very efficiently carried out within density-functional theory. On the other hand, two theoretical and computational tools have come to prominence for the description of electronic excitations. One of them, many-body perturbation theory, is based on a set of Green's-function equations, starting with a one-electron propagator and considering the electron-hole Green's function for the response. Key ingredients are the electron's self-energy Σ and the electron-hole interaction. A good approximation for Σ is obtained with Hedin's GW approach, using density-functional theory as a zero-order solution. First-principles GW calculations for real systems have been successfully carried out since the 1980s. Similarly, the electron-hole interaction is well described by the Bethe-Salpeter equation, via a functional derivative of Σ. An alternative approach to calculating electronic excitations is the time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), which offers the important practical advantage of a dependence on density rather than on multivariable Green's functions. This approach leads to a screening equation similar to the Bethe-Salpeter one, but with a two-point, rather than a four-point, interaction kernel. At present, the simple adiabatic local-density approximation has given promising results for finite systems, but has significant deficiencies in the description of absorption spectra in solids, leading to wrong excitation energies, the absence of bound excitonic states, and appreciable distortions of the spectral line shapes. The search for improved TDDFT potentials and kernels is hence a subject of increasing interest. It can be addressed within the framework of many-body perturbation theory: in fact, both the Green's functions and the TDDFT approaches profit from mutual insight. This review compares the theoretical and practical aspects of the two approaches and their specific numerical implementations, and presents an overview of accomplishments and work in progress.},

It removes the self-interaction energies of those Wannier functions, and yields accurate band gaps for solids compared to experiments. It does not have any adjustable parameters and the computational cost is at the DFT level.

Calculations are performed by using both the symmetry‐restricted and symmetry‐unrestricted molecular orbitals. To facilitate computation with high accuracy, a special curve‐fitting technique is presented. With the Kohn–Sham exchange‐only functional, our results are generally in good agreement with those of multiconfiguration self‐consistent‐field (MCSCF) calculations for the three excited states, but our calculated dissociation energy for the ground state is much lower than the MCSCF and experimental values. Inclusion of the correlation term in the density functional is found to bring the ground‐state dissociation energy very close to the experimental value but has little effect on the dissociation energy of the three excited states.

	abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density. It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s−d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or “Boys orbitals” as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.},

We argue that this is not a shortcoming, and that instead these potentials can provide, in a functional form, a simplified quasiparticle approximation to the spectral potential, i.e., the local, frequency-dependent contraction of the many-body self-energy that is sufficient to describe exactly the spectral function. As such, orbital-density-dependent functionals have the flexibility to accurately describe both total energies and quasiparticle excitations in the electronic-structure problem. In addition, and at variance with the Kohn-Sham case, orbital-dependent potentials do not require nonanalytic derivative discontinuities. We present numerical solutions based on the frequency-dependent Sham-Schlüter equation to support this view, and examine some of the existing functionals in this perspective, highlighting the very close agreement between exact and approximate orbital-dependent potentials.},

In the process, we derive a correction to approximate functionals that, in the frozen-orbital approximation, eliminates the unphysical occupation dependence of orbital energies up to the third order in the single-particle densities. This non-Koopmans correction brings physical meaning to single-particle energies; when applied to common local or semilocal density functionals it provides results that are in excellent agreement with experimental data—with an accuracy comparable to that of GW many-body perturbation theory—while providing an explicit total energy functional that preserves or improves on the description of established structural properties.},

We show that the simplest implementations of Koopmans' compliance provide accurate estimates for the quasiparticle excitations and leave the total energy functional almost or exactly intact, i.e., they describe correctly electron removals or additions, but do not necessarily alter the electronic charge density distribution within the system. Additional Koopmans-compliant functionals can be constructed that modify the potential energy surface, starting, e.g., from Perdew-Zunger corrections. These functionals become exactly one-electron self-interaction free and, as all Koopmans-compliant functionals, are approximately many-electron self-interaction free. We discuss in detail these different formulations, and provide extensive benchmarks for the 55 molecules in the reference G2-1 set, using Koopmans-compliant functionals constructed from local-density or generalized-gradient approximations.

Popular approximate functionals are thought to be devoid of a derivative discontinuity, strongly compromising their performance for prediction of spectroscopic properties. Here we show that, in fact, all exchange-correlation functionals possess a derivative discontinuity, which arises naturally from the application of ensemble considerations within DFT, without any empiricism. This derivative discontinuity can be expressed in closed form using only quantities obtained in the course of a standard DFT calculation of the neutral system. For small, finite systems, addition of this derivative discontinuity indeed results in a greatly improved prediction for the fundamental gap, even when based on the most simple approximate exchange-correlation density functional – the local density approximation (LDA). For solids, the same scheme is exact in principle, but when applied to LDA it results in a vanishing derivative discontinuity correction. This failure is shown to be directly related to the failure of LDA in predicting fundamental gaps from total energy differences in extended systems.},

The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+˜n(r), ˜nn0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(rr0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

	abstract = {We have calculated the maximally localized Wannier functions of MnO in its antiferromagnetic (AFM) rhombohedral unit cell, which contains two formula units. Electron Bloch functions are obtained with the linearized-augmented-plane-wave method within both the local-spin density (LSD) and the LSD+U schemes. The thirteen uppermost occupied spin-up bands correspond in a pure ionic scheme to the five Mn 3d orbitals at the Mn1 (spin-up) site and the four O 2s/2p orbitals at each of the O1 and O2 sites. Maximal localization identifies uniquely four Wannier functions for each O, which are trigonally distorted sp3-like orbitals. They display a weak covalent bonding between O 2s/2p states and minority-spin d states of Mn2, which is absent in a fully ionic picture. This bonding is the fingerprint of the interaction responsible for the AFM ordering, and its strength depends on the one-electron scheme being used. The five Mn Wannier functions are centered on the Mn1 site, and are atomic orbitals modified by the crystal field. They are not uniquely defined by the criterion of maximal localization and we choose them as the linear combinations that diagonalize the r2 operator, so that they display the D3d symmetry of the Mn1 site.},

	abstract = {A theorem is proved stating that in atoms, molecules, and solids, only the set of the spherical parts of the density around each nucleus determines uniquely the external potential. Therefore, the induced Kohn and Sham (KS) potential has spherical symmetry around each nucleus, and furthermore, it has the symmetry of the external potential. In this way, the inconsistencies of standard density functional theory (DFT) concerning the asymmetry of the KS potential are remedied. As a result of the above, the ground state is uniquely determined by this set of spherical densities. In the case of a symmetry group G of a Hamiltonian H, the minimizing subspace of the Hamiltonian for each irreducible representation of G is uniquely determined by this set of spherical densities. Thus, the present theory opens the way for new density functionals and more accurate molecular calculations as it exploits local symmetries. Moreover, the theory of “Atoms in Molecules” formulated by Bader, by using the open quantum mechanics theory, can be explained in terms of DFT [R. F. W. Bader, Atoms in Molecules. A Quantum Theory (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1990)].},

	abstract = {Lead halide perovskites show marked defect tolerance responsible for their excellent optoelectronic properties. These properties might be explained by the formation of large polarons, but how they are formed and whether organic cations are essential remain open questions. We provide a direct time domain view of large polaron formation in single-crystal lead bromide perovskites CH3NH3PbBr3 and CsPbBr3. We found that large polaron forms predominantly from the deformation of the PbBr3− frameworks, irrespective of the cation type. The difference lies in the polaron formation time, which, in CH3NH3PbBr3 (0.3 ps), is less than half of that in CsPbBr3 (0.7 ps). First-principles calculations confirm large polaron formation, identify the Pb-Br-Pb deformation modes as responsible, and explain quantitatively the rate difference between CH3NH3PbBr3 and CsPbBr3. The findings reveal the general advantage of the soft [PbX3]− sublattice in charge carrier protection and suggest that there is likely no mechanistic limitations in using all-inorganic or mixed-cation lead halide perovskites to overcome instability problems and to tune the balance between charge carrier protection and mobility.
Charge carriers in both hybrid and all-inorganic lead halide perovskites form large polarons.

	abstract = {We present an efficient first-principles approach for calculating Fermi surface averages and spectral properties of solids, and use it to compute the low-field Hall coefficient of several cubic metals and the magnetic circular dichroism of iron. The first step is to perform a conventional first-principles calculation and store the low-lying Bloch functions evaluated on a uniform grid of k points in the Brillouin zone. We then map those states onto a set of maximally localized Wannier functions, and evaluate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian and the other needed operators between the Wannier orbitals, thus setting up an “exact tight-binding model.” In this compact representation the k-space quantities are evaluated inexpensively using a generalized Slater-Koster interpolation. Owing to the strong localization of the Wannier orbitals in real space, the smoothness and accuracy of the k-space interpolation increases rapidly with the number of grid points originally used to construct the Wannier functions. This allows k-space integrals to be performed with ab initio accuracy at low cost. In the Wannier representation, band gradients, effective masses, and other k derivatives needed for transport and optical coefficients can be evaluated analytically, producing numerically stable results even at band crossings and near weak avoided crossings.},

Then, we consider the band gaps of 30 paradigmatic solid-state test cases, for which accurate experimental and computational results are available.

Here, we give a simple proof of a theorem: In generalized KS theory (GKS), the band gap of an extended system equals the fundamental gap for the approximate functional if the GKS potential operator is continuous and the density change is delocalized when an electron or hole is added. Our theorem explains how GKS band gaps from metageneralized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) and hybrid functionals can be more realistic than those from GGAs or even from the exact KS potential. The theorem also follows from earlier work. The band edges in the GKS one-electron spectrum are also related to measurable energies.

We demonstrate a connection between the defect charge distribution and the potential alignment, which establishes a relation between the MP and FNV schemes. Calculations are performed using supercells of various sizes and the corrected formation energies are compared to the values obtained by extrapolation to infinitely large supercells. For defects with localized charge distributions, we generally find that the FNV scheme improves upon the LZ one, while the MP scheme tends to overcorrect except for point-charge-like defects. We also encountered a class of defects, for which all the correction schemes fail to produce results consistent with the extrapolated values. This behavior is found to be caused by partial delocalization of the defect charge. We associate this effect to hybridization between the defect state and the band-edge states of the host. The occurrence of defect charge delocalization also reflects in the evolution of the defect Kohn-Sham levels with increasing supercell size. We discuss the physical relevance of the latter class of defects.},

	abstract = {We develop a systematic approach to construct energy functionals of the one-particle reduced density matrix (1RDM) for equilibrium systems at finite temperature. The starting point of our formulation is the grand potential \${\textbackslash}Omega [{\textbackslash}mathbf\{G\}]\$ regarded as variational functional of the Green's function \$G\$ based on diagrammatic many-body perturbation theory and for which we consider either the Klein or Luttinger-Ward form. By restricting the input Green's function to be one-to-one related to a set on one-particle reduced density matrices (1RDM) this functional becomes a functional of the 1RDM. To establish the one-to-one mapping we use that, at any finite temperature and for a given 1RDM \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{{\textbackslash}gamma\}\$ in a finite basis, there exists a non-interacting system with a spatially non-local potential \$v[{\textbackslash}mathbf\{{\textbackslash}gamma\}]\$ which reproduces the given 1RDM. The corresponding set of non-interacting Green's functions defines the variational domain of the functional \${\textbackslash}Omega\$. In the zero temperature limit we obtain an energy functional \$E[{\textbackslash}mathbf\{{\textbackslash}gamma\}]\$ which by minimisation yields an approximate ground state 1RDM and energy. As an application of the formalism we use the Klein and Luttinger-Ward functionals in the GW-approximation compute the binding curve of a model hydrogen molecule using an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian. We compare further to the case in which we evaluate the functionals on a Hartree-Fock and a Kohn-Sham Green's function. We find that the Luttinger-Ward version of the functionals performs the best and is able to reproduce energies close to the GW energy which corresponds to the stationary point.},
